# Ablabiri's Journey to Defeat the Evil Wizard Ernaud _(and his many battles along the way)_

## Chapter 1: Neat & Centonder East Kille and the Death's Head Jellyfish

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Neat & Centonder East Kille. A scout eyed him suspiciously. A mapmaker eyed him suspiciously. Ablabiri continued down the path. While the lutemaker loaded a market stall with wares, a mirrorer scuttled out of his way.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a armorer. The man, eying his well-made boots, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Ablabiri, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Ernaud." Ablabiri announced.

The stonecarver rushed by quickly, ignoring him with a rugmaker. The man sat in silence for a whileHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Ablabiri. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Klaes is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the stables and left. You'll see a warehouse. It's into the market and towards the cattle barn. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the cattle barn and left. You'll see a inn. It's down the street to the cattle barn and right. You'll see a monastery. It's just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 2 small coins. "I want that Ernaud gone as much as anybody."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. The housewife finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a scrivener. While the roper eyed him suspiciously, a userer threw punches. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Ablabiri cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Klaes lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The death's head jellyfish."

"Most common in warm or temperate waters, the death's head jellyfish is an aggressive predator. The creature derives its name from the pattern on its 4-foot-wide bell and from the poison it delivers with its tentacles. Those unfortunate enough to be subjected to this toxin develop rigor of the facial muscles that results in a wide-eyed grimace if left untreated." Klaes explained.

Ablabiri slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

Ablabiri saw a smelly death's head jellyfish in the distance! The adventurer readied his sword. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Ablabiri lunged toward the death's head jellyfish, his sword ready to strike! The slippery death's head jellyfish evaded Ablabiri's hit. The monster was stunned by the attack.

## Chapter 2: Brestondaley and the Death Dog

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Brestondaley. Two meat butchers threw punches. A carter eyed him suspiciously. Ablabiri continued down the path. Two surgeons scuttled out of his way.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a fiddler. The man, eying his impressive armor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Ernaud took over?" Ablabiri asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

While the girdler slowly carried supplies, a confectioner rushed by quickly, ignoring him. He still looked suspicious, then finally responded.

"Our village of Cheatery will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Gil is the best in town. His shop is past the barn. There's a small door. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. While the chandler hawked fine imported goods from Val, a scholar slept in an alleyway. A charcoalburner ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Beri. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Gil looked up from his work behind a counter at Ablabiri.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the legion archon, or perhaps even the manananggal, but that's nothing compared to the death dog we've got."

"Death dogs are disease-ridden nocturnal pack hunters. Said to be the risen corpses of dogs or hyenas animated by monster-worshiping cultists, they are actually living creatures infested with symbiotic worms. Capable of tracking their prey for miles across barren terrain, death dogs surround stronger creatures, attacking and retreating, allowing their infected bites to wear down an opponent until it is too weak to fight. A pack's territory may overlap with others of its kind without competition, though in lean times packs may skirmish over live prey or carrion." Gil explained.

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"A death dog's saliva contains hundreds of tiny eggs that grow into flesh-devouring worms. The worms don't harm the death dog, but consume any creatures they come into contact with. A death dog's corpse is contagious for several days after its demise and may infect creatures that touch or eat it. Remove disease can kill a death dog's worms and remove its disease ability, but if allowed to associate with others of its kind, its quickly becomes reinfected." Gil explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the death dog so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

"A typical death dog is 7 feet long, stands 4 feet tall at the shoulder, and weighs about 500 pounds. Death dogs may ally with hobgoblins and bugbears, though the goblinoids are not immune to the dogs' disease. Thus these alliances are often temporary." Gil explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the death dog so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Ablabiri saw a detestable death dog in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the evil sight. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 3: RÃ³mersh Nordend and the Monkey

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of RÃ³mersh Nordend. The horse trainer ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Fersimudus with a engineer. The nun finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a balancemaker. Ablabiri continued down the path. A glass seller slowly carried supplies.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a skinner. The man, eying his well-made boots, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Ablabiri, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Ernaud." Ablabiri announced.

While the drummer gazed at him from an open window, a chicken butcher talked excitedly with what appeared to be a chimney sweep. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Vall will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is down the street to the cattle barn and left. You'll see a monastery. It's into the market and towards the church. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. You'll find Phrystantas, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. A watchman sat by the side of the road. Nearby, a plumber slept in an alleyway. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Phrystantas looked up from his work behind a counter at Ablabiri.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the skinwalker, or perhaps even the great white shark, but that's nothing compared to the monkey we've got."

"Monkeys are highly social creatures. They spend the majority of their day searching for food." Phrystantas explained.

Ablabiri slipped the man 9 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Ablabiri.

Ablabiri saw a abominable monkey in the distance! Ablabiri readied his sword. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The monkey struck with its bite! The hideous monkey failed to land its hit. Ablabiri the fearlessour hero leaned on his sword to catch a moment's respite. He was worn out by the combat. The monkey struck with its bite! The hideous monkey failed to land its hit.

## Chapter 4: Ham and the Ankou

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Ham. The emperor gazed at him from an open window with a userer. While the fool for money eyed him suspiciously, a lawyer gazed at him from an open window. Ablabiri continued down the path. Nearby, a smelter scuttled out of his way.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a pioneer. The man, eying his strong forearms, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Ablabiri, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Ernaud." Ablabiri announced.

Nearby, a cook stood by a market stall, negotiating with the embroiderer. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Ablabiri. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Otebolus is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the church. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the monastery. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Otebolus Fine Supplies". I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. While the brewer rushed by quickly, ignoring him, a weeper eyed him suspiciously. Nearby, a doctor ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Balis. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Ablabiri cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Otebolus lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The ankou."

"Ankous are assassins for powerful fey nobles, sent to kill, terrify, and torture. They never speak, only telepathically whisper their lord's verdict to victims. A typical ankou is 10 feet tall and has an 8-foot wingspan, but weighs less than 100 pounds." Otebolus explained.

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Ablabiri saw a horrid ankou in the distance! Ablabiri the epicour hero readied his sword. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The ankou struck with its claws! The hideous ankou failed to land its hit. Ablabiri lunged toward the ankou, his sword ready to strike! The slippery ankou evaded Ablabiri's hit.

## Chapter 5: Heathet and the Mist Drake

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Heathet. Two horners hawked fine imported goods from Aldfortham Eastming Hampton Hild Hournospoor. Two blockcutters scuttled out of his way. Ablabiri continued down the path. The footpad bit into an apple with a glasspainter.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a typefounder. The man, eying his strong forearms, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Ernaud has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Ablabiri have come to destroy him!" Ablabiri exclaimed.

Two parchmenters hawked fine imported goods from Ray. The man quietly reminised about the past, then finally responded.

"Our village of Pimbleigh will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Barriston is the best in town. His shop is past the stables. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Barriston Fine Supplies". And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 3 small coins. "I want that Ernaud gone as much as anybody."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. A dyer stood by a market stall, negotiating with the canaller. Nearby, a knight finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Ablabiri cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Barriston grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of shriezyxs and hound of tindaloss flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Mist drakes are less openly aggressive than most drakes, as they are not as physically strong and imposing as most of their kin. Their bodies are narrow and serpentine, more suited for quick strikes and hit-and-run tactics than for close combat. However, they excel at stealth for creatures of their size, and can expel a burst of thick fog whenever they need to create a diversion or screen themselves from archers trying to target them. In the mist, they move swiftly and silently to disperse groups of foes with their explosive breath and then single out one of their enemies for a quick and deadly attack before their victim's allies can regroup and come to its rescue."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the mist drake?" Ablabiri asked.

Barriston returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Mist drakes mate only once few decades, but are more caring parents than others of their ilk. After the clutch of two to six eggs hatch, the hatchlings stay with their mother for up to 20 years before seeking out their own hunting territory. Mist drakes live up to 200 years."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the mist drake?" Ablabiri asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "A typical mist drake is 13 feet long from head to tail tip, but these lithe dragons rarely weigh more than 1,000 pounds."

Ablabiri slipped the man 5 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Ablabiri saw a ghastly mist drake in the distance! Ablabiri readied his sword. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 6: Nead and the Rat

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Nead. Nearby, a buffoon ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Lanco. A mercer talked excitedly with what appeared to be a costermonger. Ablabiri continued down the path. While the gemcutter talked excitedly with what appeared to be a feltmaker, a crossbowman threw punches.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a boatman. Ablabiri approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Ernaud took over?" Ablabiri asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

A spy slowly carried supplies. The man eyed him thoughtfully, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Ablabiri. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Isaacius is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. Tell him I sent you. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 6 small coins. "I want that Ernaud gone as much as anybody."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. A sailor sat by the side of the road. Nearby, a pickpocket slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Isaacius looked up from his work behind a counter at Ablabiri.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Isaacius lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The rat."

Isaacius returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Fecund and secretive, rats are omnivorous rodents that particularly thrive in urban areas."

Ablabiri slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

Ablabiri saw a disagreeable rat in the distance! The grandiose Ablabiri readied his sword. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The rat struck with its bite! The hideous rat failed to land its hit. Ablabiri lunged toward the rat, his sword ready to strike! The slippery rat evaded Ablabiri's hit.

## Chapter 7: Hammoutne and the Kyton

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Hammoutne. The cantor talked excitedly with what appeared to be a broderer with a trapper. A engraver ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Eshmund. Ablabiri continued down the path. The poulter rushed by quickly, ignoring him with a bishop.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a blacksmith. The man, eying his well-made boots, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Ernaud took over?" Ablabiri asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

The mailmaker threw punches with a mirrorer. He still looked suspicious, then finally responded.

"Our village of Forotiridding Bridge Eas Park will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is past the cattle barn. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Tain Fine Supplies". You'll find Tain, the best weapons expert we've got. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. While the cordwainer eyed him suspiciously, a reaper talked excitedly with what appeared to be a panter. A lutenist slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Ablabiri cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Tain grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of fuaths and small earth elementals flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"Often classified among the ranks of the infernal and called chain devils by the uninitiated, the sadomasochistic kytons are not true devils. Many suggest that kytons were natives of Hell who existed there before the advent of devilkind, while others hypothesize they were later brought to the plane by some sadistic power. Regardless of their origins, kytons roam the planes in their lust to cause and receive suffering, seeking pain through violent abductions and sadistic debauches." Tain explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the kyton so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

Tain returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The kyton presented here is a typical member of this fiendish race of outsiders, but is by no means the only type of its kind. Just as there are numerous different species of demon and devil, rumor holds that different kinds of kytons dwell in their jangling cities in Hell and on the Plane of Shadow. These kytons are invariably more powerful than the one presented here, often having spell-like abilities or hideous and unsettling special attacks along the themes of torture and pain. Rumor holds that the most powerful kytons are completely inhuman, and that these monsters are the true progenators of the kyton race—the kyton presented here but the result of unholy dalliances with their unfortunate victims."

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Ablabiri.

Ablabiri saw a mean kyton in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the scandalous sight. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 8: Stans and the Warsworn

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Stans. While the grinder threw punches, a architect threw punches. A jew scuttled out of his way. Ablabiri continued down the path. Two nuns stood by a market stall, negotiating with the rat catcher.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a stillroom maid. Ablabiri approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Ernaud has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Ablabiri have come to destroy him!" Ablabiri exclaimed.

The bronzefounder bit into an apple with a bailiff. The man eyed him thoughtfully, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Ablabiri. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is into the market and towards the church. Eventually you need to walk past the monastery. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Climisalectes Fine Supplies". You'll find Climisalectes, the best weapons expert we've got. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 9 small coins. "I want that Ernaud gone as much as anybody."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a tallowchandler hawked fine imported goods from Can. The laundress finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a fishmonger. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Ablabiri cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Climisalectes grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of chalicotheriums and somalcygots flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"Warsworns are massive undead amalgams, their ever-shifting, chaotic bodies composed of countless slain soldiers and their armor and weapons. The shambling, serpentine form of a warsworn creates a grotesque, metallic cacophony as the weapons and armor of countless souls clash as though still in the throes of a never-ending battle." Climisalectes explained.

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Climisalectes returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A warsworn forms by the will of a god or goddess of undeath or war, or spontaneously from the bloodlust and wrath of a battlefield of dead soldiers. Once created, a warsworn exists to spread the rage of war, ravage the land, and spread the carnage of battle."

Ablabiri slipped the man 7 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

The armorer sighed and continued. "A typical warsworn weighs several tons and can reach a height of up to 25 feet. A newly formed one is much smaller, but quickly consumes nearby corpses from a battlefield or mass grave and swells to its full size. It is always hungry for more dying bodies. It prefers to absorb warriors and soldiers, but willingly consumes any suitable humanoid. Its constant grinding motion breaks its component parts, giving it plenty of scrap to hurl at distant foes."

Ablabiri slipped the man 4 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

Ablabiri saw a nasty warsworn in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the hideous sight. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 9: Gol and the Shinigami

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Gol. The girdler stood by a market stall, negotiating with the woodturner with a furniture maker. Nearby, a grinder sat by the side of the road. Ablabiri continued down the path. While the pie seller rushed by quickly, ignoring him, a dairymaid bit into an apple.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a swordsmith. Ablabiri approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Ablabiri, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Ernaud." Ablabiri announced.

The hunter stood by a market stall, negotiating with the blockcutter with a sculptor. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Ethwark will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Grawo is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk past the cattle barn. It's just to the right. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. While the pavyler hawked fine imported goods from Scad, a falconer eyed him suspiciously. While the housewife talked excitedly with what appeared to be a architect, a dwarf slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Ablabiri cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Grawo grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of comozant wyrds and thriae queens flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Feared as truly impartial and merciless harbingers of death, shinigamis are relentless in their pursuit of dispensing quick and just deaths upon those who would seek to disrupt the delicate balance of life. Unlike other, more sinister bringers of doom, shinigamis do not take pleasure in their work and do not seek to impose suffering—although there are exceptions. Some individuals, aptly described by their kin as "rogue shinigamis," subscribe to either more merciful or more despicable forms of execution, and are either lawful good or lawful evil. Victims who have had their lives spared by kind shinigamis praise the angels of death for their clemency and willingness to listen to the victims' plight, while other dastardly survivors have successfully cheated or bribed their way out of death by manipulating credulous or less honorable shinigami. A shinigami is 9 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the shinigami?" Ablabiri asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Ablabiri.

Ablabiri saw a hideous shinigami in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the revolting sight. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 10: Road and the Shocker Lizard

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Road. Two papermakers hawked fine imported goods from Kentworbury Cockforost Hil. Nearby, a charcoalburner talked excitedly with what appeared to be a rivener. Ablabiri continued down the path. A old-clothes dealer bit into an apple.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a fool for money. Ablabiri approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Ernaud has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Ablabiri have come to destroy him!" Ablabiri exclaimed.

Two mercenarys hawked fine imported goods from Stren. The man quietly reminised about the past, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Ablabiri. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Clar is into the market and towards the tavern. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a hermit scuttled out of his way. Two pikemans eyed him suspiciously. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Ablabiri cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the nightcrawler, or perhaps even the karkinoi, but that's nothing compared to the shocker lizard we've got."

"A shocker lizard has a pale yellow underside, with bright green scales elsewhere on its 3-foot-long body, and weighs about 25 pounds. Shocker lizards tend toward group living, as their electrical abilities grow in power when they are close to another lizard. " Clar explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the shocker lizard so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "A shocker lizard colony is usually located near a source of water. Once the colony has settled on a location, the lizards become very territorial and attack anything that intrudes on them. A solitary shocker lizard is a timid and hesitant creature—but when several of them gather they become formidable and fearsome opponents capable of killing creatures several times their own size."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the shocker lizard so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

Clar returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A shocker lizard relies on its electricity abilities in combat, and a lizard tends to bite only after its shock has rendered an opponent unconscious, or when the shock seems to have no effect at all. A solitary lizard flees once it delivers its shocks, but if other shocker lizards are nearby, they all hone in on their comrade's discharges and attempt to administer lethal shocks to their foe."

Ablabiri slipped the man 8 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Clar returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Many have attempted to capture and tame shocker lizards, but this often proves a difficult and painful task. Alone and in captivity, shocker lizards tend to wither and die swiftly unless their keepers spend a lot of time grooming and playing with the lizards to keep them company. Kept in pairs or larger numbers, captive shocker lizards thrive, but their increasing electrical ability makes them more difficult to manage for keepers who aren't themselves immune to electricity."

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Ablabiri.

Ablabiri saw a disgusting shocker lizard in the distance! Ablabiri the unafraidour hero readied his sword. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 11: Osgorbley and the Humbaba

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Osgorbley. The housewife ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Feliam with a gravedigger. While the tallowchandler talked excitedly with what appeared to be a engineer, a maidservant finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Ablabiri continued down the path. Nearby, a philosopher sat by the side of the road.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a poacher. The man, eying his determined look, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Ablabiri, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Ernaud." Ablabiri announced.

A begger ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Girald. The man sat in silence for a whileHe finally responded.

"Our village of Minhall will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. You'll find Hydalochides, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. While the sailmaker finished an apple and tossed the core aside, a dyer slept in an alleyway. Nearby, a barrister sat by the side of the road. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Ablabiri cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Hydalochides grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of erlkings and hunter urchins flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Humbabas are monstrous humanoids of tremendous size and power that prowl the forgotten places of the world. Although a humbaba has the body of a powerful, muscular human, its face is a twisted mockery that seems more leonine than human. They often braid portions of their manes or otherwise decorate them with skulls and weapons, and prefer to wear half-plate armor and fight with longswords."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the humbaba so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

"The first humbabas were once the favored minions of the demon lord Pazuzu. In those days, humbabas had magnificent birdlike wings. But when the mightiest of the humbabas dared to attack Pazuzu in an ill-conceived attempt to claim the demon lord's throne, Pazuzu punished the entire humbaba race by stripping them of their wings and casting them into the Material Plane. There they now dwell, forever denied the skies and cursed to live lonely lives, incapable of forming even the barest of friendships or alliances with others of their kind." Hydalochides explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the humbaba so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Ablabiri saw a horrendous humbaba in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the lurid sight. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 12: Brislinghtsminghal Houtte and the Shobhad

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Brislinghtsminghal Houtte. A raker hawked fine imported goods from Caren an. The ropemaker slowly carried supplies with a emperor. Ablabiri continued down the path. While the fruitier slept in an alleyway, a limner bit into an apple.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a guardsman. The man, eying his strong forearms, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Ernaud took over?" Ablabiri asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a nailer sat by the side of the road. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Old will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is into the market and towards the warehouse. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the warehouse. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Tarcham Fine Supplies". You'll find Tarcham, the best weapons expert we've got. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 2 small coins. "I want that Ernaud gone as much as anybody."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. While the chandler hawked fine imported goods from Wal Latounboury, a archer slept in an alleyway. A blacksmith slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Ablabiri cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Tarcham grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of toads and veds flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "These fabled four-armed giants are native to a low-gravity planet and renowned across several worlds for their ferocity in battle. Most shobhads are born and come of age in fierce tribal clans known collectively as the Shobhad-neh, and disdain the "soft living" practiced by many other humanoid races—they believe the abandonment of nomadic culture is a slippery slope that leads away from individual honor and into marginalization. Whether with flashing swords and lances or mysterious longrifles capable of picking off targets on faraway horizons, the clans of the Shobhad-neh constantly vie for resources in the hard deserts and mountains where they live, their need to survive trumped only by a still greater desire for honor."

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Tarcham returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Though considered barbaric by many, the Shobhad-neh operate under strict codes of conduct that dictate how a warrior may gain status via ritualistic challenges or daring coups in territorial squabbles. Unfortunately for other races, these rules almost always apply exclusively to interactions with other shobhads, and the Shobhad-neh see "lesser" races as little more than sheep to be culled."

Ablabiri slipped the man 9 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Tarcham returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Typical shobhad warriors stand 12 feet tall and weigh 500 pounds, and their lean bodies are corded with ropes of muscle. Most shobhads prefer to go naked save for loincloths and the leather harnesses that crisscross their chests and secure their weapons in place. When they wear clothing, its either practical such as hide armor and wrappings that protect against biting sandstorms, or ceremonial like the brightly colored skins and feathers chieftains and shamans wear."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the shobhad?" Ablabiri asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Though shobhads can be found on occasion working as lone mercenaries in cities, such urban individuals are the exception rather than the rule. Shobhad shamans preach that in human cities, an individual is little more than a faceless cog in a machine, remembered by no one. Yet a shobhad warrior who rides heroically into battle atop her armored reptilian steed is never forgotten—neither by her own kin, nor by the families of those she defeats. Thus, in battle, a shobhad is made truly immortal."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the shobhad?" Ablabiri asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Ablabiri.

Ablabiri saw a offensive shobhad in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the gruesome sight. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 13: Scark Puth Greet and the Narwhal

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Scark Puth Greet. Nearby, a spearman loaded a market stall with wares. The wattler ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Gylbaduinel with a constable. Ablabiri continued down the path. A bronzefounder hawked fine imported goods from Birigh.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a poet. The man, eying his unusual weapons, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Ablabiri, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Ernaud." Ablabiri announced.

While the molecatcher slept in an alleyway, a spurrer talked excitedly with what appeared to be a fiddler. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"Our village of Cheston Squals will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Leudebratides is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the tavern and right. You'll see a cattle barn. It's into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. While the bearleader slowly carried supplies, a shipchandler scuttled out of his way. Nearby, a buckle maker stood by a market stall, negotiating with the paperer. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Leudebratides looked up from his work behind a counter at Ablabiri.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Leudebratides grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of bythoss and cervinals flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Narwhals are skilled hunters in arctic waters, and are known to dive deeper than even much larger cetaceans both in open water and beneath thick sheets of floating ice. A male narwhal possesses a single, 6-foot-long tusk extending from just above its mouth, which it uses to impress females during mating season, engaging in flashy duels with other males. In times of need, the tusks may be used to break through thick ice or even in self-defense, though most narwhals prefer to flee rather than fight. A typical narwhal is about 14 feet long (not including the tusk) and weighs 3,200 pounds."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the narwhal so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Ablabiri saw a disagreeable narwhal in the distance! Ablabiri readied his sword. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 14: Eglacken upe and the Royal Naga

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Eglacken upe. While the sculptor eyed him suspiciously, a rat catcher finished an apple and tossed the core aside. While the arkwright slowly carried supplies, a playwright scuttled out of his way. Ablabiri continued down the path. Nearby, a knight ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Amyn.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a hayward. Ablabiri approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Ernaud has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Ablabiri have come to destroy him!" Ablabiri exclaimed.

Two papermakers slept in an alleyway. The man quietly reminised about the past, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Ablabiri. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Guilhabrid is the best in town. His shop is past the tavern. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Guilhabrid Fine Supplies". And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 2 small coins. "I want that Ernaud gone as much as anybody."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a lapidary stood by a market stall, negotiating with the lady. Two stainers finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Guilhabrid looked up from his work behind a counter at Ablabiri.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Guilhabrid lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The royal naga."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Regal and proud, royal nagas haunt lost cities and forgotten kingdoms, guarding ancient treasures for their own inscrutable reasons. A royal naga's five faces are sharp and fierce, taking on a terrifying countenance when it becomes angered. Bespeaking their innate pride and vanity, royal nagas adorn their serpentine hoods and faces with elaborate and valuable piercings, crowns, or other precious accessories. Royal nagas are 18 feet long, and often weigh more than 750 pounds."

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Royal nagas tend to be stern in nature and commanding in speech. Although naturally sociable, they are distrustful of strangers and seem to have great difficulty speaking to other creatures as equals." Guilhabrid explained.

Ablabiri slipped the man 2 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

Ablabiri saw a frightful royal naga in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the menacing sight. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 15: Road and the Cameroceras

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Road. A sculptor stood by a market stall, negotiating with the buffoon. The sexton rushed by quickly, ignoring him with a peasant. Ablabiri continued down the path. While the woolman slept in an alleyway, a blockcutter loaded a market stall with wares.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a paperer. The man, eying his determined look, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Ablabiri, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Ernaud." Ablabiri announced.

Nearby, a monk sat by the side of the road. He still looked suspicious, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Ablabiri. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Poppo is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. While the landlord gazed at him from an open window, a stainer rushed by quickly, ignoring him. While the potter bit into an apple, a miner slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Poppo looked up from his work behind a counter at Ablabiri.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Poppo grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of bunyips and mimics flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "A primordial ambush predator often found in the depths where sunlight is too dim to support much plant life, the cameroceras is a grave danger to anyone who dares explore the ocean. A cameroceras can survive up to 1 mile beneath the surface, for its shell is strong enough to resist the water's pressure at such depths, though it cannot survive for long at greater depths. At times, hunger drives these beasts to higher, brighter waters. When a cameroceras enwraps prey in its tentacles, it can pull the helpless creature into its shell while sinking to the sea floor to feed at its leisure."

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Poppo returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The average cameroceras is 25 feet long, the majority of which is its long shell. Because much of a cameroceras's shell is hollow, most specimens weigh only around 2,000 pounds. In addition to its grabbing tentacles, a cameroceras has four specialized tentacles that grant it a keen sense of smell."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the cameroceras?" Ablabiri asked.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Ablabiri saw a repellent cameroceras in the distance! Ablabiri the valiantour hero readied his sword. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 16: Lon Cockbury and the Vemerak

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Lon Cockbury. Two jesters hawked fine imported goods from Newest Kens. A mosaic layer hawked fine imported goods from Nead. Ablabiri continued down the path. Two silversmiths gazed at him from an open window.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a hay merchant. The man, eying his foreboding cloak, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Ernaud took over?" Ablabiri asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

The farrier talked excitedly with what appeared to be a lady with a minnesinger. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Weld Bridge will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Chronysias is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. A buttonmaker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a camp follower. Two princes ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Alar. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Chronysias looked up from his work behind a counter at Ablabiri.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Chronysias grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of tunches and shedus flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Huge and otherworldly, the vemerak is a monster known as much for its disturbing appearance as its violent and cruel disposition."

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"A vemerak is 10 feet tall and 20 feet long, its tentacle-like tails adding a further 15 feet to its length. It weighs just over 6 tons. Caverns that serve as lairs to these creatures invariably possess disturbing shrines where the creatures offer up portions of every meal to dark gods that dwell deep below the sane world—as a result, many believe that vemeraks exist as the physical manifestation of the will of a particularly violent and insane deity." Chronysias explained.

Ablabiri slipped the man 4 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Ablabiri saw a fearful vemerak in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the shameful sight. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 17: Exet and the Small Water Elemental

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Exet. The bellmaker sat by the side of the road with a feltmaker. Nearby, a shingler ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Manax. Ablabiri continued down the path. The cartier sat by the side of the road with a fruitier.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a astrologer. The man, eying his strong forearms, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Ablabiri, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Ernaud." Ablabiri announced.

While the reaper threw punches, a oilmaker stood by a market stall, negotiating with the ship's captain. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Warn will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Heregonor is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the inn. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a nedeller slept in an alleyway. Two nedellers loaded a market stall with wares. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Ablabiri cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Heregonor lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The small water elemental."

Heregonor returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The monster small water elemental is terrifying for sure, but I honestly don't know much about that beast."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the small water elemental?" Ablabiri asked.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Ablabiri saw a unkind small water elemental in the distance! Ablabiri readied his sword. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 18: Clactone and the Phase Spider

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Clactone. A barrister finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The chamberlain slowly carried supplies with a dentist. Ablabiri continued down the path. A prince talked excitedly with what appeared to be a singer.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a burglar. The man, eying his determined look, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Ernaud took over?" Ablabiri asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Two fabricshearers threw punches. He still looked suspicious, then finally responded.

"Our village of Stral will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Chelantius is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the church. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Chelantius Fine Supplies". I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. Two fruitiers sat by the side of the road. Nearby, a hayward eyed him suspiciously. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Chelantius looked up from his work behind a counter at Ablabiri.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Chelantius grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of ostovites and akanames flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Chelantius returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Phase spiders are voracious predators from the Ethereal Plane who hunt on the Material Plane. When prey is located, the spider shifts to the Ethereal Plane to prepare an ambush. Against a lone victim, the spider shifts to the Material Plane, bites the victim, then retreats back to the Ethereal Plane to wait for the poison to take effect. Against multiple foes, a phase spider follows these same tactics, and on each round a foe remains in reach at the start of its turn, it repeats this gambit. If no foes are in reach, it moves while ethereal to prepare an attack on an available target, but unless it feels safe in spending an entire round on the Material, it won't phase back to attack unless it can do so while saving a move action for an escape."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the phase spider so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

Chelantius returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Phase spiders are the natural enemy of another denizen of the Ethereal Plane—the xill. The two races have long fought a bloody war with no real prospect of a resolution anytime soon. Were phase spiders less horrifying and alien in appearance, they might find the allies they need to defeat the sinister xill among other races, but their monstrous forms and often overwhelming hunger make diplomacy difficult."

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"On the Ethereal Plane, phase spiders can manipulate the raw smoky ether in a manner similar to how a spider manipulates webs. Vast, complex nests of semisolid ether float idly through the eddies of the Ethereal Plane, each supporting numerous phase spiders. The creatures enjoy each other's company, but have no real concept of family—a newborn phase spider is fully capable of fending for itself and is treated no differently by its parents or siblings than any other." Chelantius explained.

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "The typical phase spider is 8 feet long and weighs about 700 pounds."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the phase spider so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Ablabiri saw a mean phase spider in the distance! The gutsy Ablabiri readied his sword. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 19: Buck and the Brain Ooze

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Buck. Nearby, a ropemaker slowly carried supplies. A bath attendent finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Ablabiri continued down the path. A pioneer sat by the side of the road.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a carman. The man, eying his determined look, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Ernaud has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Ablabiri have come to destroy him!" Ablabiri exclaimed.

Nearby, a glover rushed by quickly, ignoring him. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Sournborting Cenumnon-thwarry will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Wilfer is the best in town. His shop is past the church. It's just to the left. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. While the burglar scuttled out of his way, a lanternmaker bit into an apple. A grocer eyed him suspiciously. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Wilfer looked up from his work behind a counter at Ablabiri.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the wolf, or perhaps even the taiga linnorm, but that's nothing compared to the brain ooze we've got."

"A brain ooze (sometimes known as a "killer brain") resembles almost precisely the raw brain of a human, save for the eldritch energy surrounding it and the twin tentacles extending from its sides. The creature's thought patterns are unusually powerful, and cause painful mental feedback in the minds of other conscious beings." Wilfer explained.

Ablabiri slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

" Other intelligent beings are nothing more than cattle and playthings to brain oozes—victims to be tormented, thought patterns to be consumed. Brain oozes prefer to manipulate their prey from the shadows. Rather than assaulting openly, they provoke fights and conflict within groups, or lure one or two victims away for the kill. Brain oozes derive particular satisfaction from forcing an individual to commit terrible acts, then wiping away all knowledge of the crimes from the victim's memory. They torment such hapless puppets again and again, forcing them to commit ever greater atrocities. Once weary of their sport they return the modified memories with dispel magic, and feast upon the delicious misery of the victim's final despair." Wilfer explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the brain ooze so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

"Brain oozes feed through their tentacles by extracting the thoughts of living creatures. Animals and less intelligent creatures provide little nourishment, but they prize fey, outsiders, and spellcasters as delicacies. After several feedings, a brain ooze divides into two nearly identical brains, each retaining only a portion of the knowledge and experiences of the parent." Wilfer explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the brain ooze?" Ablabiri asked.

"The similarities between intellect devourers and brain oozes have not gone unnoticed, but the two species appear to have little in common beyond appearance. Some theorize that brain oozes are actually the result of an ancient race's failed attempt to achieve immortality by preserving their minds via alien technology or magic." Wilfer explained.

Ablabiri slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Ablabiri.

Ablabiri saw a grim brain ooze in the distance! Ablabiri readied his sword. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 20: Wheterrospoodforton Ham and the Cold Rider

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Wheterrospoodforton Ham. While the librarian eyed him suspiciously, a master of hounds rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Two minnesingers stood by a market stall, negotiating with the carter. Ablabiri continued down the path. The builder hawked fine imported goods from Finge with a chandler.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a troubadour. The man, eying his foreboding cloak, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Ablabiri, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Ernaud." Ablabiri announced.

The stillroom maid bit into an apple with a glasspainter. The man quietly reminised about the pastHe finally responded.

"Our village of Haste will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Anaxanthad is into the market and towards the tavern. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. A printer ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Ezteberhdolin. While the netmaker eyed him suspiciously, a horseleech talked excitedly with what appeared to be a broderer. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him.

Anaxanthad grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of chimeras and orcas flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"Cold riders are terrifying armored majesties, clad in cloaks of frost with a pair of large crystal-blue antlers cresting their almost skeletal heads. Their icy armor and weapons are as much a part of them as their frozen flesh. Cold riders delight in perversion, slaughter, and the corruption of other fey. They prefer undead or cold-resistant steeds, but even when they have no access to such, their phantom steed spell-like ability ensures they never go long without a mount. " Anaxanthad explained.

Ablabiri slipped the man 4 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Cold riders are 7 feet tall, though their antlers easily add another 2 feet to their height. They weigh 300 pounds." Anaxanthad explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the cold rider so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Ablabiri saw a terrible cold rider in the distance! Ablabiri the nobleour hero readied his sword. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 21: Andam Stry and the Crag Linnorm

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Andam Stry. Two bookbinders eyed him suspiciously. Nearby, a dog trainer sat by the side of the road. Ablabiri continued down the path. While the pavior slowly carried supplies, a franklin eyed him suspiciously.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a theologian. Ablabiri approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Ablabiri, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Ernaud." Ablabiri announced.

Two costermongers sat by the side of the road. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Ablabiri. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is past the inn. It's just to the right. You'll find Tardus, the best weapons expert we've got. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 3 small coins. "I want that Ernaud gone as much as anybody."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. A fuller scuttled out of his way. Two privycleaners hawked fine imported goods from Nead. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Tardus looked up from his work behind a counter at Ablabiri.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Tardus lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The crag linnorm."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Like all linnorms, the deadly crag linnorm is a powerful, primeval dragon, a denizen of the wild regions far north of where most civilizations dare to tread. The crag linnorm is among the weakest of its kind, yet still a devastating predator in its own right. Favored, if not by the gods, then by some primal intelligence of the mysterious world of the fey, the linnorm bestows a powerful curse on any who manage to slay it. A crag linnorm is 60 feet long and weighs 12,000 pounds."

Ablabiri slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Ablabiri saw a appalling crag linnorm in the distance! The adventurer readied his sword. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 22: Worexham and the Dorvae

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Worexham. A pavior threw punches. The fruitier stood by a market stall, negotiating with the cowherd with a sapper. Ablabiri continued down the path. Two drywallers loaded a market stall with wares.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a rivener. The man, eying his unusual weapons, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Ernaud took over?" Ablabiri asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Two taverners threw punches. The man sat in silence for a whileHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Ablabiri. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Glycus is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the warehouse. Eventually you need to walk past the inn. It's just to the left. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 2 small coins. "I want that Ernaud gone as much as anybody."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. The nakerer threw punches with a wiredrawer. Two gravediggers threw punches. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Ablabiri cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the spring-heeled jack, or perhaps even the woolly rhinoceros, but that's nothing compared to the dorvae we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "The dorvaes are a race of fiends standing apart from all others. Each dorvae prides itself on owing no allegiance to anything but itself, and is never willing to suffer a master no matter how powerful or intelligent that creature may be. Dorvaes believe all other creatures in the universe live solely to entertain the dorvaes' perverse pleasures. Cruel, selfish, and calculating, each dorvae pursues its own dark agenda and desires without guilt, empathy for its playthings, or even consideration of the possible consequences. Master manipulators, dorvaes would rather stand back and create unquestioning minions to champion their schemes."

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Glycus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Many dorvaes meddle in the politics and power plays of evil planar beings, but a number of these fiends ply their manipulations on the Material Plane. Often they seek out primitive humanoid tribes, which they lead like vengeful and angry gods. Others look for cosmopolitan centers to manipulate, often masquerading as the mysterious leaders of foreign cults, or as the masterminds of criminal societies."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the dorvae so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Ablabiri saw a unkind dorvae in the distance! The adventurer readied his sword. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Dunsbury Weshey Laken (Oly Colvenborton. Nearby, a bellmaker eyed him suspiciously. Nearby, a thresher ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Fritz. Ablabiri continued down the path. Two shepherds slowly carried supplies.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a constable. Ablabiri approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Ablabiri, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Ernaud." Ablabiri announced.

The scrivener rushed by quickly, ignoring him with a guardsman. The man quietly reminised about the past, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Ablabiri. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Marin is down the street to the cattle barn and right. You'll see a monastery. It's into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a fruitier slowly carried supplies. Nearby, a pattenmaker slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Ablabiri cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Marin lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The meladaemon."

Marin returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "As personifications of death from starvation and thirst, these withered fiends spend their time destroying resources and spreading hunger. Deacons of the Horseman of Famine, these creatures visit worlds throughout the planes, destroying acres of crops and slaughtering livestock in order to harvest souls for their honored master. Meladaemons delight in the slow death of starvation, going so far as to experiment with various bodily deficiencies and mortal weaknesses. Arrogant and utterly bound to their patron, meladaemons rarely work with others of their kind and never serve any of the other three Horsemen except in the rarest of circumstances."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the meladaemon so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

"Meladaemons stand approximately 12 feet tall and weigh 350 pounds." Marin explained.

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Ablabiri saw a horrendous meladaemon in the distance! Ablabiri the guttyour hero readied his sword. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 24: Eas and the Papinijuwari

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Eas. While the halberdier talked excitedly with what appeared to be a glasspainter, a archbishop scuttled out of his way. A writer rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Ablabiri continued down the path. A fruitier talked excitedly with what appeared to be a fishmonger.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a roofer. The man, eying his foreboding cloak, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Ablabiri, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Ernaud." Ablabiri announced.

While the scabbard maker slowly carried supplies, a merchant talked excitedly with what appeared to be a reaper. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Scad will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Einholo is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Einholo Fine Supplies". And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 10 small coins. "I want that Ernaud gone as much as anybody."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. While the nakerer slept in an alleyway, a professor hawked fine imported goods from Rushaldge. Nearby, a solicitor slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Einholo looked up from his work behind a counter at Ablabiri.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the flesh golem, or perhaps even the ether drake, but that's nothing compared to the papinijuwari we've got."

Einholo returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Racing across the skies and preying on diseased humanoids of all kinds, the merciless, cyclopean papinijuwaris are the hated cousins of cloud giants. Even evil cloud giants regard papinijuwaris with disdain, as their hunting practices offend the more "refined" giants' delicate sensibilities."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the papinijuwari?" Ablabiri asked.

"Papinijuwaris are agents of death and pestilence, feeding off of the suffering they help to spread. In some humanoid cultures, the sight of a shooting star heralds the arrival of the dreaded papinijuwaris, who invisibly stalk through settlements at night, hastening the progression of diseases." Einholo explained.

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Einholo returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A full-grown papinijuwari stands about 20 feet tall and weighs nearly 6,000 pounds."

Ablabiri slipped the man 8 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

Ablabiri saw a dreadful papinijuwari in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the appalling sight. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 25: Harlan and the Mummy Lord

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Harlan. A oil merchant ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Hermand. Two summoners hawked fine imported goods from Ruistle. Ablabiri continued down the path. Nearby, a tallowchandler slept in an alleyway.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a stewsman. The man, eying his impressive armor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Ablabiri, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Ernaud." Ablabiri announced.

Two cartiers bit into an apple. The man quietly reminised about the past, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Mingsilto will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Lecatider is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the warehouse and left. You'll see a monastery. It's down the street to the inn and right. You'll see a church. It's into the market and towards the cattle barn. Eventually you need to walk past the tavern. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Lecatider Fine Supplies". And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 5 small coins. "I want that Ernaud gone as much as anybody."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. Two bookbinders gazed at him from an open window. Nearby, a pilot slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Ablabiri cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Lecatider grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of blood golems and dire corbys flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"Many cultures practice the sacred art of mummification, though the sinister magical techniques used to imbue corpses with undead vitality are far less widespread. In certain ancient lands, such blasphemous techniques have been refined through centuries of ceremony and countless deaths, giving rise to mummies of terrible power. On rare occasions, if the deceased was of great rank and exceeding malevolence, he might undergo such elaborate rituals, rising from his tomb as a fearful mummy lord. Similarly, a ruler known for his malice or who died in a moment of great rage might spontaneously arise as such a vengeful despot. Regardless of the exact circumstances of his resurrection, a mummy lord retains the abilities he had in life, becoming a creature consumed by the desire to restore his rule and dominate both the living and dead." Lecatider explained.

Ablabiri slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Ablabiri saw a ghastly mummy lord in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the terrifying sight. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The mummy lord struck with its spear! The hideous mummy lord failed to land its hit. Ablabiri lunged toward the mummy lord, his sword ready to strike! The slippery mummy lord evaded Ablabiri's hit.

## Chapter 26: Blackhollow and the Spring-heeled Jack

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Blackhollow. Nearby, a miller threw punches. Nearby, a trapper slowly carried supplies. Ablabiri continued down the path. A currier sat by the side of the road.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a nun. The man, eying his foreboding cloak, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Ernaud has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Ablabiri have come to destroy him!" Ablabiri exclaimed.

Two spicers gazed at him from an open window. The man sat in silence for a whileHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Ablabiri. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Endymieu is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Endymieu Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. While the lawyer stood by a market stall, negotiating with the papermaker, a pissprophet sat by the side of the road. Two fullers loaded a market stall with wares. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Endymieu looked up from his work behind a counter at Ablabiri.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Endymieu lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The spring-heeled jack."

Endymieu returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "This cruel-eyed night terror is infamous for his love of trickery and spontaneous bursts of violence. Spring-Heeled Jack stands about 4 feet tall and weighs about 80 pounds."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the spring-heeled jack?" Ablabiri asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Spring-Heeled Jack keeps up a reputation for gruesome killing sprees and tends to flee the crime scene by leaping onto buildings. He subsists on raw animal meat, from deer to house rat to beetle. His knife is often his only company, and after years of self-inflicted solitude Spring-Heeled Jack considers it his best and only friend, and has taken to calling it "Love." The finely wrought knife has no special properties, but is clearly of otherworldly origin and leaves strange scars that are impossible to reproduce."

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Chaotic and spontaneous, Spring-Heeled Jack at times lets his prey live to spread his legend. Though he doesn't commit his heinous crimes for notoriety alone, he revels in the reputation he has earned and the fear that registers in people's eyes as he pounces upon them."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the spring-heeled jack so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

"It is widely thought that Spring-Heeled Jack was at one point human, but lost his humanity in exchange for fiendish powers. The truth is that "he" is a fey creature—the best known of a race of fey creatures related to quicklings. These fey are fond of traveling to the Material Plane, where their mayhem is more feared and appreciated. To add to the mystery, they all use the same name among mortals and pretend to be the same individual." Endymieu explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the spring-heeled jack?" Ablabiri asked.

"That's all I can tell you."

Ablabiri saw a smelly spring-heeled jack in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the cruel sight. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 27: Coughampst Ken and the Giant Sea Anemone

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Coughampst Ken. Nearby, a cordwainer rushed by quickly, ignoring him. The wood seller talked excitedly with what appeared to be a housewife with a carter. Ablabiri continued down the path. Two shipchandlers talked excitedly with what appeared to be a hobbler.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a weirkeeper. Ablabiri approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Ablabiri, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Ernaud." Ablabiri announced.

The hay merchant gazed at him from an open window with a ropemaker. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Ablabiri. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Hame is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the inn and left. You'll see a inn. It's just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. Two outlaws sat by the side of the road. Nearby, a chantry priest finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Hame looked up from his work behind a counter at Ablabiri.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Hame grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of wayangs and velociraptors flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"Giant sea anemones are beautiful but deadly ocean-dwelling vermin that rely on camouflage and paralytic toxins to draw in their prey. A sea anemone has a long, cylindrical body that ends in a flat circular disc with a slitlike orifice for both ingesting food and dispelling waste. This disc is surrounded by a thicket of tendrils that vary in thickness from fine, hairlike cilia to thick, swollen appendages. The creature uses all of these tentacles at once when it attacks prey. Like their smaller kin, giant sea anemones come in a broad spectrum of colors—many are known for their brilliant hues." Hame explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the giant sea anemone?" Ablabiri asked.

Hame returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Giant sea anemones can move at a slow pace by walking along the projections at their bases. More often, however, these predators affix themselves to rock, coral, or sunken objects like ships, then wait for prey to come to them."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the giant sea anemone?" Ablabiri asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "As mindless creatures, giant sea anemones have no use for treasure, but the remains of prey digested and then expelled often litter the area around these creatures. Massive sea anemones big enough to eat dolphins, whales, or even sea serpents reportedly exist in the deepest parts of the ocean. Called deep tigers for their alternating fronds of black and brilliant orange, these giant sea anemones are said to lair in undersea ruins and sunken ships, where the promise of sought-after treasure conveniently lures in a constant food supply."

Ablabiri slipped the man 5 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Hame returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Other species of sea anemones exist as well, some smaller but most quite a bit larger and favoring different oceanic regions and depths. You can adjust the stats for the giant sea anemone by changing the Hit Dice and size (adjusting Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as appropriate) to represent a wide range of species. Often, different species have additional abilities, such as the darkforest anemone's constriction attack, or the deep tiger's ability to squirt acid. The following table lists the most common variants."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the giant sea anemone?" Ablabiri asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Ablabiri.

Ablabiri saw a terrible giant sea anemone in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the terrible sight. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 28: Ovalliff and the Maharaja

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Ovalliff. Nearby, a costermonger stood by a market stall, negotiating with the pilot. The minnesinger rushed by quickly, ignoring him with a tentsman. Ablabiri continued down the path. The bather ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Gefridus with a pikeman.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a tapestrymaker. The man, eying his unusual weapons, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Ernaud has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Ablabiri have come to destroy him!" Ablabiri exclaimed.

Two pinmakers scuttled out of his way. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Cam will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Dodger is past the barn. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Dodger Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 8 small coins. "I want that Ernaud gone as much as anybody."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a lady threw punches. Two lorimers slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Ablabiri cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Dodger lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The maharaja."

"All rakshasas aspire to power, but there are those for whom this hunger is more than an obsession: It's a birthright. Legends among the rakshasas tell of the maharajas—those rakshasas whose depredations and acts of cruelty have elevated them above others of their kind and allowed them to reincarnate as embodiments of every myth, fable, and cautionary tale involving the beast-headed fiends. Accorded the respect and deference of their lessers, maharajas inspire one emotion within the rakshasa race that few can: fear." Dodger explained.

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "A maharaja rakshasa emerges only after a rakshasa of great power and influence has spent several lives as a member of the samrata, the height of the rakshasa's social-spiritual caste system. When a rakshasa ascends to maharaja status, others of its kind take notice, with rakshasas coming from far and wide to serve even a young maharaja—eager to curry its favor at an early age. The birth of a maharaja denotes that great change is imminent: The maharaja will fulfill some terrible destiny, found a lasting nation of rakshasas, undergo some manner of divine ascension, or defeat some greater foe and commandeer its domain, often splitting the region into large enough chunks for its lieutenants and servants to claim and still have room to expand. It is rare in the extreme for more than a handful of maharajas to emerge in the same century."

Ablabiri slipped the man 7 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Dodger returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "So great is a maharaja's power and influence and so long is its life that one can spend most of its time enjoying the luxury of its years of toil. When not manipulating armies or the machinations of lesser rakshasas, it can often be found surrounded by the most beautiful of its servitors—often charmed or dominated humanoids, or, if the maharaja is powerful enough, good-aligned outsiders—lounging in opulence."

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "The lair of a maharaja is typically a glorious, decadent mansion. After decades or centuries of work, gold filigree decorates the columns, and great friezes embossed with rakshasa myths and folklore decorate the walls. Rather than couches or divans, luxurious pillows stuffed with exotic feathers and crafted from the hides of even rarer creatures serve for furniture, and all about hang the trophies of a centuries-long life of tyranny: the crowns of defeated rulers, the wealth of ruined countries, and the heads of failed lieutenants."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the maharaja?" Ablabiri asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "A maharaja's great experience and power, however, does not make it immune to or ignorant of threats. Disloyal servants, powerful kings, ambitious rivals, and meddling adventurers all might step forth to challenge a maharaja's rule. To that end, a maharaja employs devious methods to ensure its own safety, with assassination, false rumors, and illusory doubles serving as useful tools to ferret out threats. Wary of attack and often with wide territories to control, most rakshasa maharajas have several secluded palaces and lavish redoubts, and travel among them endlessly."

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"That's all I can tell you."

Ablabiri saw a hideous maharaja in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the nasty sight. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## Chapter 29: Harbictinary and the Hekatonkheires

Ablabiri followed a dirt path into the village of Harbictinary. The carter sat by the side of the road with a mason. While the milliner scuttled out of his way, a astronomer stood by a market stall, negotiating with the knight. Ablabiri continued down the path. While the philosopher talked excitedly with what appeared to be a burglar, a engraver eyed him suspiciously.

Eventually, Ablabiri arrived at the town square, where he found a lutenist. The man, eying his strong forearms, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Ablabiri, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Ernaud." Ablabiri announced.

A poulter bit into an apple. He still looked suspiciousHe finally responded.

"Our village of Cheston-on will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Wales is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the cattle barn. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the monastery and right. You'll see a barn. It's just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 2 small coins. "I want that Ernaud gone as much as anybody."

Ablabiri hurried towards the armory. While the rat catcher gazed at him from an open window, a bearleader hawked fine imported goods from Tucestley. A writer rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Wales looked up from his work behind a counter at Ablabiri.

"I'm Ablabiri, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Ernaud. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Wales grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of humbabas and giant black widow spiders flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"Horrifying abominations shunned by the gods immediately upon their creation, the hekatonkheires are perhaps the most powerful and devastating race of titans in existence. When the titans—envious of the gods' divine strength—rebelled against the deities, the hekatonkheires were among the first to pick up arms, weary of the scorn their own creators felt for them. The betrayal of the Elysian titans led to the hekatonkheires' swift capture by the gods, who found the hekatonkheires' power to be so immense that they were not banished to the Abyss with their Thanatotic brethren. Instead, the gods cast the hekatonkheires into the furthest reaches of the multiverse they could find. There, the hekatonkheires drifted in expanses of nothingness for unknown eons, and the madness wrought upon them by isolation destroyed their memories. Yet from their madness these shattered monstrosities spawned progeny to replace them in their pursuit to destroy, and some of these monstrous offspring discovered ways to break through planar boundaries and wander the multiverse freely." Wales explained.

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "The gods initially created only three hekatonkheires, seeking to make the ultimate warriors in order to guard the gates to the Abyss. These three ancient titans still drift in the unknown expanses between planes—the hekatonkheires that now walk the worlds are their lesser spawn. But these so-called "lesser" titans remain almost unimaginably powerful themselves. They have no knowledge of why their forgotten ancestors were originally banished, and so they wander in search of answers, all the while destroying entire worlds. They are warped engines of mayhem, their existence based wholly on the devastation of life and anything that might remind them of their age-old war against the gods, having inherited only the haunting ghosts of such memories from their ancestors."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the hekatonkheires?" Ablabiri asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Those hekatonkheires who have emerged back into the multiverse have done so in different realms, and to date, no record of any two of these spawn meeting one another exists. It is fortunate that only one hekatonkheires is encountered on a world at any given time, as even scholars cannot fathom the power that would arise out of two or more of the titans' collective strength. They traverse the planes alone, caring not for allies of any sort until they can remember what their purpose was when they were born eons ago."

Ablabiri slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Though hekatonkheires are as intelligent as the rest of their titan relatives, they wander with such destructive and seemingly mindless intentions that they spare no time in communicating with other creatures, especially those that would beg for mercy. The hekatonkheires were created to destroy, and so that is all they desire to do; the crushing blows of their fists and the goring slashes of their weapons speak for themselves. They serve no master, and halt their otherwise endless rampage only if called by their true names, which few—if any—mortals know. Those that do know these names speak them only in whispers, for their mere utterance seems to carry with it immeasurable power."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the hekatonkheires so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "A hekatonkheires can only be called via mighty spells such as gate if a conjurer knows the plane the titan is currently on, and only if the conjurer knows the true name of the hekatonkheires it is seeking to call. Only the mad or depraved would dare such a feat, however, as the might of one of these unique goliaths is so massive that the being cannot be controlled, and even if it is banished back to the realm from whence it came, it is never long before the hekatonkheires sets its sights on the world it visited so briefly, if only to sate its lust for destroying it."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the hekatonkheires so bad?" Ablabiri responded.

"Each hekatonkheires has 50 heads and 100 arms so that one is never caught off guard. The stones that it hurls with its 100 hands are as big as boulders, and those who have seen a hekatonkheires hurl such rocks and lived to tell the tale have said that it is as though an entire mountain is falling from the sky. In addition to their unworldly strength, hekatonkheires are known for their awesome control over the powers of lightning and thunder, and an individual hekatonkheires's arrival is often prefaced by an abrupt and tumultuous storm in the area. Like all titans, hekatonkheires are immortal, and do not die unless they are slain." Wales explained.

Ablabiri looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"A hekatonkheires is 50 feet tall and weighs 25 tons." Wales explained.

Ablabiri slipped the man 9 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

Ablabiri saw a awful hekatonkheires in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the unholy sight. Ablabiri hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!
