# Malchambalde's Journey to Defeat the Evil Wizard Otes _(and his many battles along the way)_

## <a name="chapter1"></a> Chapter 1: Gon and the Wereboar (human Form)

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Gon. The harper scuttled out of his way with a mariner. A builder finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Malchambalde continued down the path. The stewsman eyed him suspiciously with a lady.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a restaurateur. Malchambalde approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Malchambalde, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Otes." Malchambalde announced.

A silkmaid finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Malchambalde. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Gomerien is the best in town. His shop is past the barn. It's just to the left. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. The ferryman slept in an alleyway with a drywaller. While the oil merchant ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Nigs, a hermit scuttled out of his way. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Malchambalde cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the thought eater, or perhaps even the medium air elemental, but that's nothing compared to the wereboar (human form) we've got."

Gomerien returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The monster wereboar (human form) is terrifying for sure, but I honestly don't know much about that beast."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the wereboar (human form) so bad?" Malchambalde responded.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

## <a name="chapter2"></a> Chapter 2: Wimble Eas and the Black Pudding

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Wimble Eas. A fishmonger loaded a market stall with wares. While the franklin ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Fast, a cobbler threw punches. Malchambalde continued down the path. While the broderer threw punches, a bowyer loaded a market stall with wares.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a armorer. The man, eying his foreboding cloak, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Otes took over?" Malchambalde asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a siege engineer bit into an apple. The man quietly reminised about the past, then finally responded.

"Our village of Wokefor will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Saxos is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Saxos Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a chantry priest gazed at him from an open window. Nearby, a ditcher talked excitedly with what appeared to be a confectioner. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Saxos looked up from his work behind a counter at Malchambalde.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Saxos grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of chimeras and half-celestial unicorns flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Saxos returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Black puddings are the scavengers of the underworld, constantly on the lookout for a meal. They can sense organic or metallic objects within 60 feet and mindlessly attack such items or beings until they are dissolved or the ooze is killed. A black pudding reproduces by breaking off a piece of its body and forming a new, smaller black pudding, which grows to full size in 1 month's time. Some of the more intelligent creatures in the underworld use black puddings as natural garbage disposals, creating stone pits to house the pudding and throwing organic refuse or foes in as needed."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the black pudding so bad?" Malchambalde responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Larger specimens of black puddings have been encountered in the deepest parts of the world, with Gargantuan individuals having up to 30 HD. Other colored puddings are rumored to exist, with white ones living in the arctic, brown ones living in swamps, and tan ones living in deserts."

Malchambalde slipped the man 2 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

Malchambalde saw a gruesome black pudding in the distance! Malchambalde readied his sword. Malchambalde hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter3"></a> Chapter 3: Sme and the Giant Frilled Lizard

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Sme. Nearby, a groom loaded a market stall with wares. A halberdier rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Malchambalde continued down the path. Nearby, a curate sat by the side of the road.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a scout. Malchambalde approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Otes took over?" Malchambalde asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Two barbers gazed at him from an open window. The man eyed him thoughtfully, then finally responded.

"Our village of Lake End-dÃ« will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. You'll find Emambkin, the best weapons expert we've got. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. While the beerbrewer loaded a market stall with wares, a link man gazed at him from an open window. While the singer threw punches, a gunsmith slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Emambkin looked up from his work behind a counter at Malchambalde.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Emambkin lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The giant frilled lizard."

The armorer sighed and continued. "This lizard is a true behemoth—an apex predator found in tropical regions. Many species of giant lizard exist—other species lack this lizard's intimidating charge special ability but might have other special attacks like grab, trip, constrict (with a bite), or pounce."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the giant frilled lizard so bad?" Malchambalde responded.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Malchambalde.

## <a name="chapter4"></a> Chapter 4: Preen and the Jotund Troll

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Preen. While the harper scuttled out of his way, a cartwright loaded a market stall with wares. A rat catcher talked excitedly with what appeared to be a cartwright. Malchambalde continued down the path. While the smith eyed him suspiciously, a bodger scuttled out of his way.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a sawyer. Malchambalde approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Otes took over?" Malchambalde asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

While the chancellor hawked fine imported goods from Dudburst, a jeweler hawked fine imported goods from Arsburtock. He still looked suspiciousHe finally responded.

"Our village of Pargark will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Hann is into the market and towards the inn. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Hann Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. The abbot stood by a market stall, negotiating with the attendent with a porter. Nearby, a rat catcher slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Malchambalde cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Hann grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of stringy demodands and bogeymans flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Jotund trolls are gigantic, nine-headed horrors. Prowling frigid moors and marshes, these rapacious creatures have the same insatiable appetites of common trolls but require much more sustenance because of their excessive size. Jotund trolls stand 30 feet tall and weigh roughly 25,000 pounds. They can live for up to 100 years."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the jotund troll so bad?" Malchambalde responded.

"The jotund troll's nine heads each have their own brains and senses, but they share, after a fashion, the same mind. Despite this, a jotund troll's heads often argue and bicker, particularly over which head gets to eat. The fact that all nine maws lead to the same shared stomach makes little difference in such culinary disagreements. " Hann explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the jotund troll?" Malchambalde asked.

"Jotund trolls spawn with either their own kind or with other trolls. In the latter case, there is only a 5% chance the offspring will be a jotund troll. Apart from brief mating periods, jotund trolls are solitary, although some cull together bands of other giants into devastating war parties that can lay waste to entire regions. " Hann explained.

Malchambalde slipped the man 7 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

## <a name="chapter5"></a> Chapter 5: Dundorth Ealis and the Phantom Fungus

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Dundorth Ealis. A netmaker sat by the side of the road. The parchmenter hawked fine imported goods from Londa Vaull with a link man. Malchambalde continued down the path. The basinbeater stood by a market stall, negotiating with the wheelwright with a oil merchant.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a solicitor. Malchambalde approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Otes has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Malchambalde have come to destroy him!" Malchambalde exclaimed.

A tillerman rushed by quickly, ignoring him. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Malchambalde. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Florus is down the street to the barn and right. You'll see a tavern. It's past the inn. It's just to the left. Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a tutor stood by a market stall, negotiating with the pilgrim. A chimney sweep gazed at him from an open window. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Malchambalde cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Florus grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of hangman trees and vouivres flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"A phantom fungus is a tripedal carnivorous plant that roams the vast and deep underground caverns of the world. It wanders in search of food, using its rootlike feet to detect movement along the cavern floors and the sensitive tendrils surrounding its mouth to pinpoint prey." Florus explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the phantom fungus?" Malchambalde asked.

Florus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A phantom fungus's primary advantage as a predator is its ability to vanish from sight. Stealthily patrolling the perimeters of caverns, a phantom fungus remains invisible until it is behind its prey, at which point it snaps at its victim with its vicious maw."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the phantom fungus?" Malchambalde asked.

"A phantom fungus prefers to ambush lone creatures. When it encounters a larger group, a phantom fungus often stalks prey for hours, waiting for the targets to spread out or make camp so that it may attack a single foe at its leisure. Though phantom fungi are not normally pack hunters, there are reports of groves working together to bring down larger foes. When faced with no other option than to attack multiple foes, a group of phantom fungi focuses its attacks on single targets. They prefer to attack noisier foes if possible—characters wearing heavy armor or those that make heavy use of loud attacks (such as bards or spellcasters) are preferred over quieter creatures." Florus explained.

Malchambalde slipped the man 9 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Florus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The maw with which a phantom fungus attacks prey is lined with row upon row of sharp, jagged teeth that resemble pointed rocks more than actual fangs. This "mouth" is not used to feed, however, and does not attach to a digestive tract—it is nothing more than a gaping natural weapon. When a phantom fungus feeds, it does so by squatting down on its prey and infesting the corpse with thousands of feeding filaments that burrow through dead flesh to siphon away nutrients. "

Malchambalde looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Florus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A typical phantom fungus is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds. Although they prefer dwelling underground, they have been encountered above ground as well."

Malchambalde slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Malchambalde.

Malchambalde saw a repulsive phantom fungus in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the lurid sight. Malchambalde hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Malchambalde lunged toward the phantom fungus, his sword ready to strike! The phantom fungus was struck by the blow! The phantom fungus struck with its bite! He winces from the pain but continues fighting. Malchambalde lunged toward the phantom fungus, his sword ready to strike! Malchambalde landed a massive hit on phantom fungus! 

The phantom fungus struck with its bite! The fierce blow from the monster narrowly misses the adventurer. He leaned on his sword to catch a moment's respite. He was worn out by the combat. The phantom fungus leans low, ready to strike with its might. 

He pulls a neon green potion from his pack and drinks it. He is reinvigorated. The phantom fungus leans low, ready to strike with its might.

Malchambalde says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Florus was talking about."

## <a name="chapter6"></a> Chapter 6: Shol Gare and the Owlbear

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Shol Gare. The spectaclesmaker ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Deinfride with a spice merchant. Two halberdiers stood by a market stall, negotiating with the grinder. Malchambalde continued down the path. While the sailor stood by a market stall, negotiating with the dentist, a ditcher talked excitedly with what appeared to be a wiredrawer.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a barrister. The man, eying his determined look, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Malchambalde, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Otes." Malchambalde announced.

While the dog trainer rushed by quickly, ignoring him, a cannoneer stood by a market stall, negotiating with the ragpicker. He still looked suspicious, then finally responded.

"Our village of Manaley will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Oxarchepar is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk past the cattle barn. There's a small door. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. A wetnurse ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Philberi. While the architect eyed him suspiciously, a purse maker scuttled out of his way. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Oxarchepar looked up from his work behind a counter at Malchambalde.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Oxarchepar lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The owlbear."

The armorer sighed and continued. "The origin of the owlbear is a subject of great debate among scholars of the monstrous creatures of the world. However, most concur that at some point in the distant past, a deranged wizard created the original specimens by crossing an owl with a bear—perhaps as proof of some insane concept about the nature of life, but possibly out of sheer lunacy. Whatever the original purpose of such a freakish creation as the owlbear, the creature bred true and has become quite well-established in woodlands across the world, where it plays a key role in a region's ecosystem as an apex predator."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the owlbear so bad?" Malchambalde responded.

"Owlbears are notoriously bloodthirsty killers, well known for their short tempers, aggression, and savage nature. They tend to attack without provocation, slaughtering any living creatures that cross their paths. Many scholars that have encountered these creatures in the wild have noted that they all have red-rimmed eyes that roll about wildly when they close in for an attack. This is sometimes presented as a sign of madness, suggesting that all owlbears are born with a pathological need to fight and kill, but more level-headed researchers believe that it's simply part of the way the massive bird-beast's keen eyes are constructed." Oxarchepar explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the owlbear so bad?" Malchambalde responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Owlbears generally inhabit desolate areas of the wilderness, making their messy lairs within wild forests or inside dark, shallow caverns. They are equally adept at hunting during the day and at night, depending upon the prey available near their lairs."

Malchambalde looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Adult owlbears live in mated pairs, and hunt in small groups, leaving their young behind in their lairs while they search for prey. A typical owlbear lair contains 1d6 juveniles, which can fetch a price of up to 3,000 gp apiece in many city markets." Oxarchepar explained.

Malchambalde slipped the man 4 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"While it is considered impossible to truly domesticate owlbears due to their feral natures, they can still be used as guardians if contained within an area but allowed to roam and hunt freely there. Professional animal trainers charge up to 2,000 gp to rear or train an owlbear into a serviceable guardian that can obey simple commands (DC 23 for a juvenile creature; DC 30 for a fully grown adult)." Oxarchepar explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the owlbear?" Malchambalde asked.

"A full-grown male can stand as tall as 8 feet and weighs up to 1,500 pounds." Oxarchepar explained.

Malchambalde looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Malchambalde.

Malchambalde saw a disgusting owlbear in the distance! The adventurer readied his sword. Malchambalde hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter7"></a> Chapter 7: Pell and the Wax Golem

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Pell. Two shipchandlers talked excitedly with what appeared to be a master of hounds. Nearby, a cartwright stood by a market stall, negotiating with the brushbinder. Malchambalde continued down the path. A merchant loaded a market stall with wares.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a stonecarver. Malchambalde approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Malchambalde, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Otes." Malchambalde announced.

A feltmaker threw punches. The man eyed him thoughtfully, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Malchambalde. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is down the street to the stables and right. You'll see a cattle barn. It's down the street to the barn and right. You'll see a cattle barn. It's just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. You'll find Alecton, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. The harness maker threw punches with a master of hounds. Nearby, a builder rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Malchambalde cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Alecton lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The wax golem."

Alecton returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. ""

Malchambalde slipped the man 8 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"" Alecton explained.

Malchambalde looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "A wax golem is an exact replica of a particular person, composed completely of wax. While skilled artists pride themselves on their ability to make wax sculptures look lifelike, builders of wax golems go one step further and actually bring their art to life. Though eerily silent and unblinking, well-built wax golems bear such striking similarity to the subjects they are modeled after that some golems begin to think they are in fact that person."

Malchambalde looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"A wax golem can be constructed to resemble any person or creature." Alecton explained.

Malchambalde looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Malchambalde.

## <a name="chapter8"></a> Chapter 8: Rayle and the Shinigami

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Rayle. While the feltmaker bit into an apple, a delver ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Faldus. Two fences sat by the side of the road. Malchambalde continued down the path. Two jews scuttled out of his way.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a canon. Malchambalde approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Malchambalde, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Otes." Malchambalde announced.

Nearby, a maid hawked fine imported goods from Rockfridgway. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Borth will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Segus is into the market and towards the warehouse. Eventually you need to walk past the barn. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Segus Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. A tailor threw punches. The shipchandler sat by the side of the road with a swordsmith. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Malchambalde cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Segus lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The shinigami."

"Feared as truly impartial and merciless harbingers of death, shinigamis are relentless in their pursuit of dispensing quick and just deaths upon those who would seek to disrupt the delicate balance of life. Unlike other, more sinister bringers of doom, shinigamis do not take pleasure in their work and do not seek to impose suffering—although there are exceptions. Some individuals, aptly described by their kin as "rogue shinigamis," subscribe to either more merciful or more despicable forms of execution, and are either lawful good or lawful evil. Victims who have had their lives spared by kind shinigamis praise the angels of death for their clemency and willingness to listen to the victims' plight, while other dastardly survivors have successfully cheated or bribed their way out of death by manipulating credulous or less honorable shinigami. A shinigami is 9 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds." Segus explained.

Malchambalde looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"That's all I can tell you."

Malchambalde saw a disgusting shinigami in the distance! He readied his sword. Malchambalde hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter9"></a> Chapter 9: Blackneridne and the Popobala

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Blackneridne. Nearby, a waterman slept in an alleyway. The musician sat by the side of the road with a thresher. Malchambalde continued down the path. The barrister scuttled out of his way with a quarryman.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a canon. Malchambalde approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Malchambalde, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Otes." Malchambalde announced.

While the beekeeper threw punches, a gunsmith finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The man eyed him thoughtfully, then finally responded.

"Our village of Chridner will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is past the barn. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Flore Fine Supplies". You'll find Flore, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. Two spice merchants eyed him suspiciously. Two joiners hawked fine imported goods from Stond-dÃ«. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Flore looked up from his work behind a counter at Malchambalde.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Flore grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of contract devils and totenmaskes flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Flore returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The popobala is a much-feared shapeshifter that haunts and hunts warm coastal lands, roaming night and day to terrorize and spread anarchy and unrest while slaking its insatiable twin urges for violence and prurience. Shifting freely between bat, human, and its natural form, the popobala is most dreaded for its mesmeric charms, but it is more than capable of engaging in savage bloodletting against those who anger it. Popobalas are attracted to chaos, anarchy, and unrest, as the intensity of emotions and uncertainty inflames its already fierce urges. War, changes of government, and religious or ethnic strife or persecution—all of these excite a popobala, and if a society remains too settled and stable, the beast is never above fomenting unrest through its own predations."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the popobala?" Malchambalde asked.

"A typical popobala is 5 feet tall with a 12 foot wingspan. It weighs only 100 pounds. " Flore explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the popobala so bad?" Malchambalde responded.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Malchambalde.

Malchambalde saw a repulsive popobala in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the appalling sight. Malchambalde hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

While the waterman talked excitedly with what appeared to be a fresco painter, a librarian rushed by quickly, ignoring him.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a fishmonger. Malchambalde approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Otes took over?" Malchambalde asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Two hatmakers loaded a market stall with wares. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Fark will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Brantios is down the street to the inn and right. You'll see a tavern. It's just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. A nailmaker hawked fine imported goods from Suth EreenhamblesminnÃºninaullang. While the currier bit into an apple, a locksmith talked excitedly with what appeared to be a shipwright. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Brantios looked up from his work behind a counter at Malchambalde.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Brantios lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The giant frilled lizard."

"This lizard is a true behemoth—an apex predator found in tropical regions. Many species of giant lizard exist—other species lack this lizard's intimidating charge special ability but might have other special attacks like grab, trip, constrict (with a bite), or pounce." Brantios explained.

Malchambalde slipped the man 9 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Malchambalde.

Malchambalde saw a loathsome giant frilled lizard in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the horrendous sight. Malchambalde hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The stouthearted Malchambalde was victorious! The giant frilled lizard menaced for no longer! 

## <a name="chapter11"></a> Chapter 11: Blaccadingsidge and the Contract Devil

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Blaccadingsidge. While the baker eyed him suspiciously, a stewsman sat by the side of the road. Nearby, a engineer finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Malchambalde continued down the path. A curate finished an apple and tossed the core aside.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a bricker. Malchambalde approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Otes has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Malchambalde have come to destroy him!" Malchambalde exclaimed.

Two curriers ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Kemene. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Edhentok will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. You'll find Godefridurandus, the best weapons expert we've got. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 3 small coins. "I want that Otes gone as much as anybody."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a joiner slowly carried supplies. Two pardoners gazed at him from an open window. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Malchambalde cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Godefridurandus lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The contract devil."

"A contract devil, also a called phistophilus, always appears handsome and confident, its chiseled features housing a perpetually smug grin. Contract devils have red skin and black hair and stand near 6-1/2 feet in height, not counting their horns. The thicket of horns around a contract devil's body increases its height to 7 feet and its weight to 350 pounds." Godefridurandus explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the contract devil so bad?" Malchambalde responded.

Godefridurandus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. " They exist to keep track of the damned,  to manage Hell's endless ordinances, and, when time and opportunity permit, to coax mortals into damnation. Most phistophiluses spend their eternities in the various courts of Hell's nine layers, particularly in the maze-like fortress-libraries where all infernal laws and oaths are recorded. Occasionally they serve similar roles on the Material Plane when summoned by particularly desperate, arrogant, or foolish mortals."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the contract devil so bad?" Malchambalde responded.

"When one of the souls damned by a contract devil is restored to life (typically via powerful magic like a wish or miracle), the phistophilus immediately notices the transgression. Usually, the contract devil recruits the aid of more powerful allies to track down and punish such transgressors and to collect the escaped soul as quickly as possible." Godefridurandus explained.

Malchambalde slipped the man 10 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Malchambalde saw a menacing contract devil in the distance! He readied his sword. Malchambalde hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter12"></a> Chapter 12: Ken and the Cerebric Fungus

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Ken. While the sailor scuttled out of his way, a philosopher talked excitedly with what appeared to be a woodturner. Two armorers scuttled out of his way. Malchambalde continued down the path. A vintner rushed by quickly, ignoring him.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a sawyer. The man, eying his strong forearms, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Malchambalde, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Otes." Malchambalde announced.

A cheesemaker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a saddler. The man eyed him thoughtfullyHe finally responded.

"Our village of Fins Cove will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Thurus is past the barn. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 6 small coins. "I want that Otes gone as much as anybody."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a emperor stood by a market stall, negotiating with the dean. While the bookprinter scuttled out of his way, a shipwright scuttled out of his way. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Thurus looked up from his work behind a counter at Malchambalde.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Thurus lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The cerebric fungus."

Thurus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Cerebric fungi are a race of carnivorous, intelligent fungi native to a distant planet. Although they are one of the lowliest life forms on their homeworld, the fungi still possess an alien intellect far beyond that of most terrestrial creatures. Cerebric fungi display great curiosity about other races and species when they visit other worlds, asking endless, apparently senseless, questions and engaging in disturbing experiments. Some eccentric scholars claim to have learned unsettling secrets from these interrogations."

Malchambalde looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Although capable of fine manipulation with their prehensile filaments, cerebric fungi normally forgo the use of weapons in favor of their natural attacks."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the cerebric fungus so bad?" Malchambalde responded.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Malchambalde.

Malchambalde saw a unholy cerebric fungus in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the mean sight. Malchambalde hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The cerebric fungus struck with its bite! Malchambalde reeled back in pain. he stumbles to his knee, gasping for breath. The cerebric fungus struck with its bite! Malchambalde the inflatedour hero blocks the strike with his sword.

Malchambalde says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Thurus was talking about."

## <a name="chapter13"></a> Chapter 13: Strider and the Dvorovoi

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Strider. While the fiddler scuttled out of his way, a oyster raker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a organist. While the reaper slowly carried supplies, a summoner loaded a market stall with wares. Malchambalde continued down the path. The saltboiler ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Liza with a fence.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a salter. The man, eying his determined look, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Otes has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Malchambalde have come to destroy him!" Malchambalde exclaimed.

Nearby, a jew bit into an apple. The man quietly reminised about the pastHe finally responded.

"Our village of Slon will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Dith is the best in town. His shop is past the monastery. It's just to the left. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. A privycleaner ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Malapanett. Two braziers slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Dith looked up from his work behind a counter at Malchambalde.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Dith grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of tophets and festering spirits flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Just as domovoi protect the home, dvorovoi protect villagers' yards and pastures. Intrigued by tales of the creatures' guardianship, some farmers lure dvorovoi to their fields by leaving offerings of bread, sheep's wool, or shiny trinkets. When the owner of a farmstead with a dvorovoi purchases a new animal, he leads it through the yard to introduce it to the dvorovoi, hoping to gain the fey creature's approval of the new livestock."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the dvorovoi?" Malchambalde asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Though undeniably useful to have around for feeding the cattle and keeping predators away from flocks, dvorovoi can be capricious. Dvorovoi despise any white animal, and will never tolerate a white-furred horse or cow in their presence. For unknown reasons, dvorovoi don't hold this same grudge toward white chickens."

Malchambalde slipped the man 2 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Malchambalde saw a execrable dvorovoi in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the hideous sight. Malchambalde hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter14"></a> Chapter 14: Aber Breetton Pariddle and the Ghoran

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Aber Breetton Pariddle. The bookprinter threw punches with a coiner. While the wattler stood by a market stall, negotiating with the rat catcher, a rat catcher slept in an alleyway. Malchambalde continued down the path. The limner bit into an apple with a outlaw.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a roofer. The man, eying his dangerous demeanor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Otes has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Malchambalde have come to destroy him!" Malchambalde exclaimed.

Nearby, a mercer ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Merius. The man sat in silence for a whileHe finally responded.

"Our village of Hudbur will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Gunzurinus is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the cattle barn. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 10 small coins. "I want that Otes gone as much as anybody."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. While the shoemaker stood by a market stall, negotiating with the broderer, a bleacher slowly carried supplies. Nearby, a furrier slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Malchambalde cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the cave fisher, or perhaps even the mummified gynosphinx, but that's nothing compared to the ghoran we've got."

"Ghorans arose from plant life created by advanced druidic magic to be an especially hardy and adaptive food source for humans. Over the centuries, the plants evolved sentience and ambulatory bodies that mimicked the appearance of humanoids as a method to discourage their enemies from hunting them and improve their chances of survival. Their creators did not imbue them with the ability to create more of the ghorus seeds that give them life, so ghorans are fanatically protective of these seeds and consider destroying them the worst of crimes." Gunzurinus explained.

Malchambalde looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Malchambalde saw a awful ghoran in the distance! He readied his sword. Malchambalde hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Gunzurinus was talking about."

## <a name="chapter15"></a> Chapter 15: Toottad and the Adlet

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Toottad. Two restaurateurs threw punches. A glover scuttled out of his way. Malchambalde continued down the path. Two friars loaded a market stall with wares.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a bookbinder. The man, eying his determined look, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Malchambalde, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Otes." Malchambalde announced.

While the baker stood by a market stall, negotiating with the lawyer, a astronomer threw punches. The man quietly reminised about the past, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Harderf will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. You'll find Pyle, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. While the restaurateur threw punches, a constable sat by the side of the road. The crofter finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a dairymaid. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Pyle looked up from his work behind a counter at Malchambalde.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Pyle lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The adlet."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Adlets are cunning hunters of the arctic wilds. Tall, sinewy, nimble, and very quick, they see themselves as the true heritors of untamed arctic lands, and are offended by any other humanoid species that attempts to settle in such regions. Although not normally evil, adlets are very aggressive and warlike. They also have no social taboo against cannibalism, and their practice of eating their dead rather than burying them only further builds misconceptions about their morality."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the adlet?" Malchambalde asked.

"Deeply religious, adlets worship the power and cruelty of nature, seeing divinity in the lash of the blizzard's wind, the ferocity of the polar bear, and the immensity of the towering iceberg. Many become oracles or druids, but all adlets know their place in the natural world. One in every dozen adlets is a shaman: an adlet with the advanced creature template and the ability to summon a greater ice elemental or 1d4+1 large ice elementals (see Bestiary 2 114) and commune with nature once per day each as spell-like abilities. An adlet is 6 feet tall and weighs 250 pounds." Pyle explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the adlet?" Malchambalde asked.

"That's all I can tell you."

Malchambalde saw a grisly adlet in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the hideous sight. Malchambalde hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter16"></a> Chapter 16: War and the Woolly Rhinoceros

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of War. The cabinetmaker gazed at him from an open window with a bishop. While the master of hounds eyed him suspiciously, a bearleader slowly carried supplies. Malchambalde continued down the path. While the ditcher slowly carried supplies, a plowman threw punches.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a king. The man, eying his unusual weapons, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Otes has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Malchambalde have come to destroy him!" Malchambalde exclaimed.

While the emperor talked excitedly with what appeared to be a master of hounds, a pavyler threw punches. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Malchambalde. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Sigion is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Sigion Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. The grinder bit into an apple with a dwarf. Two hatmakers bit into an apple. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Malchambalde cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Sigion grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of scarab swarms and hyenas flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "The woolly rhinoceros is an herbivore, though unlike its non-woolly cousin it grazes for food rather than browsing on larger plants. The woolly rhino is legendary for its foul temper, and its size and huge horn give it a ferocious bravery. Any threat (real or perceived) to the rhino or its herd is met with loud bellows and the stomping of feet. Often, those who unwittingly anger a woolly rhino have no time to amend the intrusion before the beast attacks. "

Malchambalde slipped the man 8 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Malchambalde.

Malchambalde saw a unkind woolly rhinoceros in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the grisly sight. Malchambalde hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter17"></a> Chapter 17: Ald and the Intellect Devourer

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Ald. Nearby, a crofter talked excitedly with what appeared to be a abbot. The currier hawked fine imported goods from RivinghganniÃ« with a grocer. Malchambalde continued down the path. Two jews stood by a market stall, negotiating with the master of hounds.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a porter. The man, eying his foreboding cloak, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Malchambalde, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Otes." Malchambalde announced.

Nearby, a mosaic layer talked excitedly with what appeared to be a goldsmith. The man quietly reminised about the pastHe finally responded.

"Our village of Cal will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Strai Fine Supplies". You'll find Strai, the best weapons expert we've got. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 8 small coins. "I want that Otes gone as much as anybody."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. While the ostler bit into an apple, a bailiff finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The oilmaker scuttled out of his way with a alewife. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Malchambalde cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the crag linnorm, or perhaps even the tatzlwyrm, but that's nothing compared to the intellect devourer we've got."

Strai returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Thought by some to be invaders from another dimension or planet, the sinister intellect devourers are certainly one of the world's cruelest races. Incapable of experiencing emotions or wallowing in the sins of physical pleasure on their own, intellect devourers are forced to steal bodies in order to indulge their gluttony, lust, and cruelty. Stories tell of entire cities of these creatures deep underground, where host bodies are worn like clothes to hideous orgies and vile feasts. Lone intellect devourers often dwell in ruins or caves on the edge of a civilized region so they can make periodic forays into town to "shop" for an attractive new body."

Malchambalde slipped the man 7 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

The armorer sighed and continued. "An intellect devourer is 3 feet long and weighs about 60 pounds."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the intellect devourer so bad?" Malchambalde responded.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Malchambalde.

Malchambalde saw a execrable intellect devourer in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the eerie sight. Malchambalde hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter18"></a> Chapter 18: Wey-Bown and the Sea Cat

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Wey-Bown. While the goatherd slept in an alleyway, a philosopher hawked fine imported goods from King Caminctingh. The piper hawked fine imported goods from Bouthortsburnt with a trapper. Malchambalde continued down the path. The belter slept in an alleyway with a ironmonger.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a potboy. Malchambalde approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Otes has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Malchambalde have come to destroy him!" Malchambalde exclaimed.

Nearby, a shoemaker sat by the side of the road. The man quietly reminised about the past, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Malchambalde. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. You'll find Philkides, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. Two shoemakers slowly carried supplies. While the diplomat bit into an apple, a theologian gazed at him from an open window. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Malchambalde cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Philkides lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The sea cat."

The armorer sighed and continued. "The feral sea cat (sometimes referred to as the sea lion, sea tiger, or sea leopard) is among the most vicious and ubiquitous of coastal predators in tropical oceans. The upper body of a sea cat is that of a typical great cat—a lion, tiger, leopard, or cheetah—complete with a pair of clawed paws capable of rending the flesh from its prey. In place of back legs, however, the sea cat has a sleek and powerful tail that allows it to move quickly and silently through the water."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the sea cat?" Malchambalde asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "While only the back half of a sea cat looks fishlike, its entire body from the neck down is covered in fine scales and fins. Among individual sea cats, these scales vary greatly in color and pattern, often influenced by the primary habitat of a given specimen; the most common sea cats, have bright coloration in striped or spotted patterns. A typical sea cat is 12 feet long and weighs upward of 800 pounds."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the sea cat so bad?" Malchambalde responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Sea cats can survive in both fresh and salt water, though most live in the ocean, where they can hunt a varied and consistent supply of food. A sea cat's diet typically consists of fish, crustaceans, and aquatic mammals (including seals and otters), but the creature's overpowering predatory and territorial instincts often lead it to attack ocean birds, humanoids, and even other aquatic predators like sharks and crocodiles. Coastal fishermen in areas where sea cats are known to dwell watch vigilantly for the predators, because the beasts have learned that netted or hooked prey is easier to kill and steal from the line."

Malchambalde looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Sea cats breathe air, not water. When not hunting they can be found on coastal rocks, coral islands, or even isolated beaches sunning themselves and digesting their most recent meals. Whether hunting or protecting its territory, a sea cat generally attacks immediately upon discovering a target, even when faced with a much larger or more dangerous foe." Philkides explained.

Malchambalde looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"The sea cat's low intelligence and high level of ferocity make it incredibly difficult to train or domesticate, though pirates and aquatic races have been known to try, with limited success." Philkides explained.

Malchambalde looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Malchambalde saw a menacing sea cat in the distance! Malchambalde the undauntedour hero readied his sword. Malchambalde hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Malchambalde lunged toward the sea cat, his sword ready to strike! The sea cat was struck by the blow! The monster was stunned by the attack. Malchambalde lunged toward the sea cat, his sword ready to strike! The slippery sea cat evaded Malchambalde's hit.

## <a name="chapter19"></a> Chapter 19: Debrington Cith and the Pazuzu

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Debrington Cith. While the porter finished an apple and tossed the core aside, a builder sat by the side of the road. The besom maker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a summoner with a glasspainter. Malchambalde continued down the path. Nearby, a blockcutter ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Renos.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a scrivener. The man, eying his unusual weapons, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Otes has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Malchambalde have come to destroy him!" Malchambalde exclaimed.

While the stonecarver hawked fine imported goods from Eas Paria, a pattenmaker rushed by quickly, ignoring him. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Malchambalde. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Nivelet is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the inn. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. While the crofter bit into an apple, a falconer slept in an alleyway. A bellmaker bit into an apple. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Nivelet looked up from his work behind a counter at Malchambalde.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Nivelet lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The pazuzu."

Nivelet returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Pazuzu is among the oldest and most powerful of all demon lords. His Abyssal realm is located in one of that plane's greatest rifts. This vertical realm includes an immense city, at the heart of which can be found Shibaxet, Pazuzu's personal rookery and palace."

Malchambalde looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Pazuzu appears as a four-winged, 15-foot-tall fiend. He takes great delight in corrupting mortals, particularly those of a pure heart and soul, offering them any one wish in return for nothing but their innocence." Nivelet explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the pazuzu?" Malchambalde asked.

"That's all I can tell you."

Malchambalde saw a obnoxious pazuzu in the distance! He readied his sword. Malchambalde hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter20"></a> Chapter 20: Linast and the Annis Hag

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Linast. Nearby, a sailor threw punches. Two potters hawked fine imported goods from Blas oft. Malchambalde continued down the path. Two summoners slept in an alleyway.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a buttonmaker. The man, eying his well-made boots, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Otes has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Malchambalde have come to destroy him!" Malchambalde exclaimed.

Nearby, a executioner slowly carried supplies. The man quietly reminised about the past, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Malchambalde. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Rodberturridericus is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the cattle barn and right. You'll see a cattle barn. It's into the market and towards the monastery. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Rodberturridericus Fine Supplies". Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. The scrivener rushed by quickly, ignoring him with a armorer. While the fool for money loaded a market stall with wares, a nailer bit into an apple. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Rodberturridericus looked up from his work behind a counter at Malchambalde.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the glabrezu, or perhaps even the kraken, but that's nothing compared to the annis hag we've got."

Rodberturridericus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Also known as black hags or iron hags, annis hags are the largest and most physically intimidating of their foul brood. Known for their iron-hard, wart-covered skin that varies from shades of deep blue to black and their claws like rusty blades, annis hags forgo much of the cunning and deceptiveness of their kind to revel in the more visceral evils of torture and slaughter. The typical annis hag stands just over 8 feet tall and weighs upward of 300 pounds."

Malchambalde looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Dwelling in dark caves, tangled hollows, and cursed ruins deep within frozen swamps or icy moors, annis hags stalk forth by night to sow fear and hunt the unwary. Although possessed of cunning minds, annis prove more decadent than most other hags, frequently indulging in their taste for living flesh and the music of pleading screams. Unlike green hags, they use their ability to assume humanoid form via alter self not to infiltrate societies but to lure victims into a false sense of security before attacking—often posing as travelers in need of aid or pilgrims seeking to share a camp."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the annis hag so bad?" Malchambalde responded.

"Annis hags find the flesh of children, young animals, and the pure of heart particularly pleasing, both for the tenderness of such meals and for the sorrow such murders spread. After gorging themselves, these hags delight in stripping the skin from their victims, often garbing themselves in the grisly trophies. They are also known to retain and even preserve identifiable portions of their victims (such as heads) for later use in spreading misery. An annis who eats the children of a local farmer might keep the heads (or at least the faces) handy to return to the victims' parents, for example—often in the guise of an anonymous gift. The most insidious of annis hags present these gifts in ways that implicate friends or family in the victim's death." Rodberturridericus explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the annis hag?" Malchambalde asked.

"Like most hags, annis sometimes join covens of their repulsive sisters, though many prove resistant to such cooperation. They are particularly unlikely to join covens that already include other annis, though groups of related annis—typically horrible triplets—are not unknown. A typical annis coven consists of one annis leader along with two green hags or sometimes even a witch or two. Annis covens often seek to recruit additional creatures as guardians and are particularly fond of trolls and ogres for such roles." Rodberturridericus explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the annis hag?" Malchambalde asked.

"That's all I can tell you."

## <a name="chapter21"></a> Chapter 21: Streen and the Sea Drake

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Streen. The thimbler threw punches with a nurse. Nearby, a buffoon scuttled out of his way. Malchambalde continued down the path. Nearby, a milliner gazed at him from an open window.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a crofter. The man, eying his strong forearms, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Otes has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Malchambalde have come to destroy him!" Malchambalde exclaimed.

The vintner finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a milliner. He still looked suspiciousHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Malchambalde. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Airoclepiodorostrand is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a singer sat by the side of the road. A engraver hawked fine imported goods from Ders. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Airoclepiodorostrand looked up from his work behind a counter at Malchambalde.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Airoclepiodorostrand lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The sea drake."

Airoclepiodorostrand returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "While obviously the product of draconic inbreeding, the heritage of sea drakes is less clear than that of other drakes. Among the strongest of the drakes, sea drakes still lack the mental acuity of their true dragon forebears, though they remain as brutally cunning as other drakes. Although amphibious, sea drakes spend the majority of their time in shallow coastal waters."

Malchambalde slipped the man 9 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Sea drakes are up to 14 feet long from their noses to the tips of their powerful tails. They weigh 2,000 pounds." Airoclepiodorostrand explained.

Malchambalde looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Airoclepiodorostrand returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The most solitary of all drakes, sea drakes prefer to hunt alone. Occasionally, however, they band together in packs to hunt larger prey. Such rampages can be a significant danger to coastal shipping."

Malchambalde looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Malchambalde.

## <a name="chapter22"></a> Chapter 22: Eweridersmiton and the Dragon Horse

Malchambalde followed a dirt path into the village of Eweridersmiton. A goldsmith gazed at him from an open window. A pastrycook sat by the side of the road. Malchambalde continued down the path. The cartier scuttled out of his way with a lorimer.

Eventually, Malchambalde arrived at the town square, where he found a professor. Malchambalde approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Malchambalde, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Otes." Malchambalde announced.

Two footpads slept in an alleyway. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Malchambalde. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Gaylos is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Gaylos Fine Supplies". I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Malchambalde hurried towards the armory. The confectioner finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a plattner. While the begger ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Pagos, a beekeeper scuttled out of his way. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Gaylos looked up from his work behind a counter at Malchambalde.

"I'm Malchambalde, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Otes. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Gaylos lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The dragon horse."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Despite their name, dragon horses are not related to dragons. These noble creatures gain their name from their ability to fly through the air without wings and to create different effects with their misty breath."

Malchambalde slipped the man 4 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Dragon horses are solitary creatures, spending most of their time up among the clouds and rarely setting hoof to solid ground. A mated pair of dragon horses remains together to raise its young, but otherwise individuals prefer to be on their own. They are fierce and reclusive, but peaceful and even playful under the right circumstances. Dragon horses sometimes offer aid and assistance to decent folk in need, taking care to use their ability to know alignment to avoid accidentally providing aid to evil creatures, whom they despise." Gaylos explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the dragon horse so bad?" Malchambalde responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Dragon horse foals are highly prized as potential steeds, but as dragon horses are highly intelligent creatures, they cannot be trained as if they were animals. Instead, one who seeks a dragon horse mount must use diplomacy to secure the creature's aid."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the dragon horse so bad?" Malchambalde responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Peaceful creatures by nature, dragon horses prefer to avoid combat by flying away. When they are forced to fight (often in response to an evil creature's mayhem), they attempt to deal nonlethal damage to all but evil-aligned foes, leaving any unconscious opponents unharmed. Those who have chosen evil ways may sometimes receive the same mercy, in the hope that it helps them see the light, but innately evil foes are dispatched as quickly and cleanly as possible."

Malchambalde slipped the man 5 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Malchambalde saw a shocking dragon horse in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the ungodly sight. Malchambalde hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The dragon horse leans low, ready to strike with its might. The dragon horse struck with its hooves! The ungodly dragon horse failed to land its hit.
