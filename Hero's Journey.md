## <a name="chapter1"></a> Chapter 1: Newburnempiketter and the Carrion Golem

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Newburnempiketter. While the turner loaded a market stall with wares, a minnesinger loaded a market stall with wares. Two farmers slept in an alleyway. Alkmain continued down the path. A baker loaded a market stall with wares.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a weirkeeper. Alkmain approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Alkmain, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Hippus." Alkmain announced.

While the pinmaker scuttled out of his way, a plasterer finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The man eyed him thoughtfully, then finally responded.

"Our village of Upmingswickpon will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Anger is the best in town. His shop is past the church. There's a small door. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. A siever gazed at him from an open window. Two bailiffs loaded a market stall with wares. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Alkmain cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Anger lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The carrion golem."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Filth Fever: Slam—injury; save Fortitude DC 14; onset 1d3 days; frequency 1/day; effect 1d3 Dex damage and 1d3 Con damage; cure 2 consecutive saves."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the carrion golem so bad?" Alkmain responded.

"Carrion golems are made from the partially decayed parts of numerous dead creatures—no two carrion golems are exactly alike in appearance. Most are created from the corpses of humanoid creatures that are then augmented here and there with parts taken from animals, resulting in a monster that stands 6 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds." Anger explained.

Alkmain slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Alkmain saw a execrable carrion golem in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the lurid sight. Alkmain hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

Alkmain says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Anger was talking about."

## <a name="chapter2"></a> Chapter 2: Croxley Cirk and the Snapping Turtle

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Croxley Cirk. Nearby, a pewterer stood by a market stall, negotiating with the wattler. A cartwright eyed him suspiciously. Alkmain continued down the path. A cobbler sat by the side of the road.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a hatmaker. The man, eying his unusual weapons, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Hippus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Alkmain have come to destroy him!" Alkmain exclaimed.

Nearby, a vintner rushed by quickly, ignoring him. The man quietly reminised about the past, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Alkmain. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Iobarnous Fine Supplies". You'll find Iobarnous, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. The smelter stood by a market stall, negotiating with the laundress with a ropemaker. Two lawyers rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Iobarnous looked up from his work behind a counter at Alkmain.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Iobarnous lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The snapping turtle."

Iobarnous returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Snapping turtles are water-dwelling reptiles known for their propensity to bite anyone they deem threatening. Adult snapping turtles are usually about 1-1/2 feet in diameter. A spellcaster who can acquire a familiar can choose a snapping turtle as a familiar. A snapping turtle familiar grants its master a +2 bonus on all Fortitude saves."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the snapping turtle so bad?" Alkmain responded.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Alkmain.

Alkmain saw a sickie snapping turtle in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the offensive sight. Alkmain hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The snapping turtle struck with its bite! The adventurer jumps out of the way. Alkmain lunged toward the snapping turtle, his sword ready to strike! The attack from the epic Alkmain surely left a impression.

## <a name="chapter3"></a> Chapter 3: Woothoterminalhamptown and the Hyakume

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Woothoterminalhamptown. Nearby, a feltmaker eyed him suspiciously. A papermaker scuttled out of his way. Alkmain continued down the path. The beadle talked excitedly with what appeared to be a furrier with a carman.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a forester. Alkmain approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Alkmain, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Hippus." Alkmain announced.

The lady ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Odullin with a hurdle maker. He still looked suspiciousHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Alkmain. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Richolopophormon is the best in town. His shop is past the barn. There's a small door. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. The purse maker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a cabinetmaker with a ragpicker. Two privycleaners bit into an apple. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Alkmain cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the tengu, or perhaps even the cthulhu, but that's nothing compared to the hyakume we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Hideous and corpulent, with numerous eyes dotting their bodies, hyakumes are mystics of malevolence. They steal and collect the memories of other intelligent beings to increase their own knowledge."

Alkmain slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

Alkmain saw a revolting hyakume in the distance! Our hero readied his sword. Alkmain hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter4"></a> Chapter 4: Heathorton and the Twigjack

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Heathorton. The barrister ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Ouenus with a harness maker. The mirrorer rushed by quickly, ignoring him with a solicitor. Alkmain continued down the path. Nearby, a bodger threw punches.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a hatmaker. Alkmain approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Alkmain, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Hippus." Alkmain announced.

Nearby, a wetnurse eyed him suspiciously. The man eyed him thoughtfullyHe finally responded.

"Our village of Roadal will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Callipos is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Callipos Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 7 small coins. "I want that Hippus gone as much as anybody."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. The chapman rushed by quickly, ignoring him with a sexton. Two plumbers threw punches. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Alkmain cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the wraith, or perhaps even the annihilator, but that's nothing compared to the twigjack we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Deep in old-growth forests, twigjacks spend their time tormenting intruders and wreaking havoc on settlers. Maladjusted protectors of the wood, these malicious fey constantly threaten any attempts to civilize the wild. Twigjacks delight in breaking wagon wheels from expansionists' caravans, snapping hunters' bows, and sabotaging isolated cabins and villages. Although they possess a keen intellect, few creatures, even other fey, can tolerate these twig-born creatures for long. Treants especially find twigjacks bothersome, and resent any suggestion that they are related. Equally, twigjacks resent being considered plants, and are proud of their fey heritage. Twigjacks sometimes go out of their way to impress dryads, an effort that is rebuffed almost every time. But some spriggans, quicklings, and other evil fey associate with twigjacks, and while goblins fear and distrust the creatures, bugbears often bully them into service."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the twigjack so bad?" Alkmain responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Gnarled sticks bundled by vines and brambles form a twigjack's entire body. Atop its head, a mossy growth not unlike hair sprouts. The creature's eyes appear as vacant dark knotholes, and its mouth is just a canyon of splintered and broken sticks bisecting its face. Leaves and sprigs of new growth randomly sprout from the creature's body."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the twigjack so bad?" Alkmain responded.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Alkmain saw a lousy twigjack in the distance! The noble Alkmain readied his sword. Alkmain hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

He pulls a ruddy potion from his pack and drinks it. He is reinvigorated. The twigjack struck with its spear! The impavid Alkmain stunbles backward, gasping for breath. 

The twigjack leans low, ready to strike with its might. Alkmain lunged toward the twigjack, his sword ready to strike! A sharp crack was heard as the strike left its mark.

He was victorious! The twigjack menaced for no longer! 

## <a name="chapter5"></a> Chapter 5: Arsfiel Garrehandond Par and the Sangoi

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Arsfiel Garrehandond Par. A harberdasher bit into an apple. Nearby, a pioneer finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Alkmain continued down the path. While the bard bit into an apple, a spicer threw punches.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a trapper. Alkmain approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Hippus took over?" Alkmain asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

A dentist eyed him suspiciously. The man quietly reminised about the past, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Alkmain. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is past the monastery. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Bitxikiandros Fine Supplies". You'll find Bitxikiandros, the best weapons expert we've got. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 4 small coins. "I want that Hippus gone as much as anybody."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. A taverner stood by a market stall, negotiating with the silkwoman. Nearby, a armorer ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Osbertus. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Bitxikiandros looked up from his work behind a counter at Alkmain.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Bitxikiandros lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The sangoi."

"Sometimes mistaken for vampires, sangois are evil nocturnal fey that haunt towns and graveyards, feeding on blood and hunting by the sounds of victims' hearts. They prefer humanoid blood but settle for animal blood when hungry." Bitxikiandros explained.

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Sangoi stand 4 feet tall and weigh 35 to 40 pounds." Bitxikiandros explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the sangoi?" Alkmain asked.

"That's all I can tell you."

Alkmain saw a scary sangoi in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the nasty sight. Alkmain hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter6"></a> Chapter 6: Croth Woot and the Rishi Manu

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Croth Woot. The doctor bit into an apple with a chaplain. A nakerer talked excitedly with what appeared to be a sailor. Alkmain continued down the path. While the singer slept in an alleyway, a spurrer bit into an apple.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a mailmaker. Alkmain approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Hippus took over?" Alkmain asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Two harpers finished an apple and tossed the core aside. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Suthwatfortlaigh Barney will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Berna is past the barn. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. Two bowmans scuttled out of his way. Two bonecarvers hawked fine imported goods from Ayleigh Hillouth. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Alkmain cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Berna grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of ghuls and chernobues flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"Rishi manus are the shepherds of entire worlds, watching for shifts in the collective consciousness and gently nudging specific individuals of significant power or influence toward paths of enlightenment that will affect as many others as possible." Berna explained.

Alkmain slipped the man 9 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

## <a name="chapter7"></a> Chapter 7: Blancon and the Killer Seahorse

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Blancon. Two threshers ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Charman. While the seneschal stood by a market stall, negotiating with the gemcutter, a arkwright finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Alkmain continued down the path. Two saddlers ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Weneko.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a milliner. The man, eying his dangerous demeanor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Hippus took over?" Alkmain asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a coiner hawked fine imported goods from Bol Briell. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"Our village of Breen Cen Brist will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. You'll find Godemocydes, the best weapons expert we've got. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 4 small coins. "I want that Hippus gone as much as anybody."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a abbess slowly carried supplies. Nearby, a professor talked excitedly with what appeared to be a belter. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Alkmain cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Godemocydes lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The killer seahorse."

The armorer sighed and continued. "These specially bred offshoots of the giant seahorse are used by aquatic creatures as guard animals. Vicious and territorial, they prefer larger prey and have been known to eat giant crabs and careless handlers. Killer seahorses are too unruly for use as mounts and only accept riders or baggage if magically controlled."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the killer seahorse so bad?" Alkmain responded.

"Killer seahorses have been known to crush other creatures into a bloody pulp just before giving birth, ensuring a good meal for their newborns (called "fry"). A killer seahorse fry is the size of a human hand and is an aggressive swarm feeder, like a piranha." Godemocydes explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the killer seahorse?" Alkmain asked.

"A light load for a killer seahorse is up to 2,500 pounds, a medium load is 4,900 pounds, and a heavy load is 7,400 pounds. A killer seahorse can drag 36,800 pounds." Godemocydes explained.

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"That's all I can tell you."

## <a name="chapter8"></a> Chapter 8: Edgel and the Kalavakus

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Edgel. While the chantry priest slowly carried supplies, a midwife gazed at him from an open window. Two miners hawked fine imported goods from Nord. Alkmain continued down the path. A balancemaker threw punches.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a peasant. The man, eying his strong forearms, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Hippus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Alkmain have come to destroy him!" Alkmain exclaimed.

The pilgrim stood by a market stall, negotiating with the lawyer with a joiner. He still looked suspicious, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Alkmain. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is down the street to the cattle barn and left. You'll see a warehouse. It's past the monastery. There's a small door. You'll find Geramisisthion, the best weapons expert we've got. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 2 small coins. "I want that Hippus gone as much as anybody."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. The chimney sweep hawked fine imported goods from Cansfooll with a jester. The bricker loaded a market stall with wares with a fool. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Geramisisthion looked up from his work behind a counter at Alkmain.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Geramisisthion lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The kalavakus."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Known to some as "horned demons," the kalavakus demons are hulking, muscled beasts. They work as slavers on the Abyss, sometimes as harem keepers or captains of the guard for a more powerful demon, and at other times as mercenaries who sell their captured victims for profit to anyone with the funds to pay."

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"A kalavakus is 7 feet tall and weighs 450 pounds. They form from the souls of evil mortals who were slavers in their mortal lives." Geramisisthion explained.

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

## <a name="chapter9"></a> Chapter 9: Bathfor and the Storm Hag

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Bathfor. The smith threw punches with a mapmaker. The thimbler threw punches with a delver. Alkmain continued down the path. Two chaplains stood by a market stall, negotiating with the silversmith.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a carver. The man, eying his determined look, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Hippus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Alkmain have come to destroy him!" Alkmain exclaimed.

The combmaker finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a sea captain. The man quietly reminised about the past, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Alkmain. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. You'll find Icar, the best weapons expert we've got. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 4 small coins. "I want that Hippus gone as much as anybody."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. While the bookprinter slept in an alleyway, a tillerman talked excitedly with what appeared to be a herald. A singer slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Alkmain cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Icar lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The storm hag."

The armorer sighed and continued. "When the clouds turn gray and the winds pick up into a howl, wise travelers pray that the cause is only a natural tempest and not a storm hag. A storm hag resembles an old woman with a thundercloud of hair. Her mouth hangs open, revealing thin pointed teeth with small arcs of electricity jumping across them. Black talons sprout from her fingertips, likewise crackling with electricity. A storm hag weighs 70 pounds and stands around 4 feet tall, though if she stood up straight she could easily reach 5 feet."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the storm hag so bad?" Alkmain responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Alkmain says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Icar was talking about."

## <a name="chapter10"></a> Chapter 10: North and the Grick

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of North. The ragpicker bit into an apple with a bookprinter. The huntsman threw punches with a restaurateur. Alkmain continued down the path. While the water carrier stood by a market stall, negotiating with the confectioner, a beguine stood by a market stall, negotiating with the jailer.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a ropemaker. Alkmain approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Alkmain, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Hippus." Alkmain announced.

Two navigators hawked fine imported goods from Easenasey. He still looked suspicious, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Alkmain. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Ippos is the best in town. His shop is past the monastery. There's a small door. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 6 small coins. "I want that Hippus gone as much as anybody."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. A landlord hawked fine imported goods from Ashole. A hurdle maker bit into an apple. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Ippos looked up from his work behind a counter at Alkmain.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the giant dragonfly, or perhaps even the giant muckdweller, but that's nothing compared to the grick we've got."

Ippos returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The worm-like grick is a terror of the caverns and tunnels in which it dwells, lying in wait near heavily traveled underground passages or subterranean cities for the chance to reach forth from the darkness and take its prey. Those laid low by a grick are rarely consumed on the spot. Instead, fresh food is hauled back to the grick's lair in a tight burrow or high on a cavern ledge, where it is consumed in small bites at the grick's leisure."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the grick so bad?" Alkmain responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "The origins of the grick are not known. Even though the grick has a rudimentary intelligence, it does not have any society to speak of, and most are encountered alone. On those occasions when unfortunate travelers meet multiple specimens, groups of gricks do not appear to communicate or work together; each instead attacks individual targets and retreats with its prize as soon as it manages to bring down an opponent. Capable predators, gricks also have a strangely weapon-resistant hide that makes them especially dangerous. Many novice adventurers have fallen to grick attacks merely because they were unable to damage the creature with their nonmagical weapons. Those that are familiar with gricks (especially dwarves, morlocks, and troglodytes) know the best strategy for dealing with them is to fall back and wait for more powerful or magical reinforcements."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the grick?" Alkmain asked.

Ippos returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Gricks rely on their dark coloration and ability to climb walls to keep them out of sight until they're ready to spring an ambush. On occasions when food is scarce in a given region, gricks have been known to travel to the surface and roam the wilderness in search of prey, but these sojourns are almost always out of necessity, and end as soon as the gricks find entrances to new subterranean lairs. They prefer darkness and the comfort of a ceiling overhead, avoiding the open sky and going to great lengths to keep the cover of trees, low clouds, or buildings between them and the empty gulf overhead."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the grick?" Alkmain asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Alkmain.

Alkmain saw a horrid grick in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the beastly sight. Alkmain hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Alkmain lunged toward the grick, his sword ready to strike! The grick was struck by the blow! The grick struck with its bite! The fierce blow from the monster narrowly misses the fire-eating Alkmain.

The grick struck with its bite! He blocks the strike with his sword. he stumbles to his knee, gasping for breath. The grick leans low, ready to strike with its might. 

Alkmain says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Ippos was talking about."

## <a name="chapter11"></a> Chapter 11: St Hale and the Redcap

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of St Hale. A nun scuttled out of his way. The monk hawked fine imported goods from Tow with a seneschal. Alkmain continued down the path. Nearby, a cardmaker ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Printzi.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a seamstress. Alkmain approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Hippus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Alkmain have come to destroy him!" Alkmain exclaimed.

A goldsmith rushed by quickly, ignoring him. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Wilingornostolcher will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Unsegisme is past the stables. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. While the builder threw punches, a tutor slept in an alleyway. The sheepshearer gazed at him from an open window with a philosopher. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Alkmain cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Unsegisme lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The redcap."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Redcaps embody both capriciousness and sadism. These stumpy, misanthropic fey freaks exist seemingly to indulge in blissful bloodletting and self-indulgent slaughter. Like prune-faced, angry old men, they mollycoddle their own inefficiencies and miseries in gore. Redcaps are most widely recognized for their long woolen caps, which they drench in the blood of their victims. Rumors and fairy stories abound concerning rituals and the cultural significance of their blood-soaked caps, though the practice likely evolved as an easy way for the brutish runts to create both fear and spectacle. Redcaps typically stand only 3 feet tall, with twisted frames, pointed ears, and long white beards. They dress in soiled leather armor and wear oversized, iron-shod boots that make a distinctive clanging when they run."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the redcap so bad?" Alkmain responded.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Alkmain.

Alkmain saw a repulsive redcap in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the fairy sight. Alkmain hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter12"></a> Chapter 12: Kills and the Mithral Golem

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Kills. The smith bit into an apple with a abbot. While the illuminator loaded a market stall with wares, a harlot loaded a market stall with wares. Alkmain continued down the path. Nearby, a horse trainer scuttled out of his way.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a painter. Alkmain approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Hippus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Alkmain have come to destroy him!" Alkmain exclaimed.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Alkmain. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Prymnes is past the monastery. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. A mosaic layer loaded a market stall with wares. While the harper bit into an apple, a housewife eyed him suspiciously. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Alkmain cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Prymnes lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The mithral golem."

The armorer sighed and continued. "The monster mithral golem is terrifying for sure, but I honestly don't know much about that beast."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the mithral golem so bad?" Alkmain responded.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

## <a name="chapter13"></a> Chapter 13: Sudbridge and the Xtabay

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Sudbridge. Nearby, a shipwright talked excitedly with what appeared to be a scabbard maker. Nearby, a upholder eyed him suspiciously. Alkmain continued down the path. The woodcarver slept in an alleyway with a waxchandler.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a tentsman. Alkmain approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Hippus took over?" Alkmain asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a bard scuttled out of his way. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"Our village of Mingsburn will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Thorus is into the market and towards the church. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 8 small coins. "I want that Hippus gone as much as anybody."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. The poacher talked excitedly with what appeared to be a cordwainer with a maidservant. A chimney sweep gazed at him from an open window. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Thorus looked up from his work behind a counter at Alkmain.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the cat lord, or perhaps even the ramidreju, but that's nothing compared to the xtabay we've got."

Thorus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Known for their potent—and ultimately deadly—scent, xtabays are a floral hazard to the unwary. As fast-spreading as ivy, a xtabay's vines are sturdy and adaptive, making the plant a potential threat nearly everywhere—from gardens to wells to forest groves."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the xtabay so bad?" Alkmain responded.

"Attractive flowers blossom from the vines of xtabays, emitting the spores that mean a slow death for their victims. The strange, face-like patterns that grow on the petals are disturbing but seem to have no real function. Hermits or other reclusive types have been known to surround their territory with xtabays, warding off pesky creatures and adventurers alike. Instances of xtabays of larger-than-usual size have also been reported. These massive plants possess tendrils as thick as tree limbs and flowers that can fell even the hardiest of warriors with their overwhelming perfume. Underground, xtabays thrive in the wet, dark environment, covering the walls and floors of entire caverns and anesthetizing whole dens of subterranean creatures." Thorus explained.

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Thorus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Nomadic plants, xtabays traverse large expanses of land until they sense nearby life, at which point they lie dormant and take on the guise of harmless flowers while releasing their deceptive aroma. Once a creature is subdued, the beast-like plant wastes no time in devouring it, disregarding creatures unaffected by its aroma. Because of their carnivorous nature, xtabays only rarely run short on nutrients, consuming the entirety of a victim's body over the course of several days following the initial process of draining its blood. Xtabays are able to devour creatures thanks to their lengthy roots, which produce a corrosive acid that breaks down and absorbs flesh and bone."

Alkmain slipped the man 5 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Alkmain saw a nasty xtabay in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the scandalous sight. Alkmain hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The adventurer sneaked around to xtabay's blind spot. The xtabay struck with its stings! Alkmain reeled back in pain. 

The xtabay leans low, ready to strike with its might. Alkmain lunged toward the xtabay, his sword ready to strike! Although he's hit landed, xtabay is mostly unphased

Our hero pulls a cherry potion from his pack and drinks it. He is reinvigorated. The xtabay leans low, ready to strike with its might. 

Alkmain lunged toward the xtabay, his sword ready to strike! The slippery xtabay evaded Alkmain's hit. The monster was stunned by the attack. Alkmain lunged toward the xtabay, his sword ready to strike! A sharp crack was heard as the strike left its mark. 

Alkmain lunged toward the xtabay, his sword ready to strike! The slippery xtabay evaded Alkmain's hit. The xtabay struck with its stings! The fierce blow from the monster narrowly misses he. Alkmain lunged toward the xtabay, his sword ready to strike! The slippery xtabay evaded Alkmain's hit. 

He sneaked around to xtabay's blind spot. The xtabay leans low, ready to strike with its might. 

Alkmain says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Thorus was talking about."

## <a name="chapter14"></a> Chapter 14: Greend and the Nightgaunt

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Greend. A master of hounds sat by the side of the road. Nearby, a crossbowman hawked fine imported goods from North Kend. Alkmain continued down the path. Two tapestrymakers talked excitedly with what appeared to be a organist.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a waxchandler. The man, eying his impressive armor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Hippus took over?" Alkmain asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

The feltmaker ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Gillo with a oilmaker. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Alkmain. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Edmos Fine Supplies". You'll find Edmos, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. The gunsmith finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a halberdier. While the spinster bit into an apple, a apothecary stood by a market stall, negotiating with the tallowchandler. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Alkmain cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Edmos lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The nightgaunt."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Nightgaunts haunt the deepest and darkest chasms of dreams. They lurk in the shadows that loom at the edges of sane slumber, but are ready at any moment to snatch a blithe dreamer away, carrying it off into realms of endless nightmare and tickling it terribly all the way. They appear as stooped, emaciated humanoids, yet possess a remarkable strength in their sinewy limbs. With inky black skin, batlike wings, a long spiny tail, and demonic horns protruding from its skull, a nightgaunt is a fearsome foe—yet the lack of any facial features is what makes it truly nightmarish."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the nightgaunt?" Alkmain asked.

"A typical nightgaunt would stand 7 feet tall if fully upright, and weighs 175 pounds." Edmos explained.

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Nightgaunts feed on emotions, preferring despair, horror, and nervous laughter. They enjoy carrying their prey high over the mountains, tickling their prey to create a mix of emotions, and finally dropping their victims in remote areas where other monsters can stalk and kill them. Some creatures pay nightgaunts to serve as guardians or carry them from place to place, though the nightgaunts are prone to turn on their employers at the smallest slight."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the nightgaunt so bad?" Alkmain responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Most nightgaunts have little interest in anything other than sating their hunger on sleepers, and gather in colonies to entertain each other by sharing emotion-memories through strange caresses. They sometimes war with the other creatures found in their desolate realms."

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Alkmain.

Alkmain saw a hideous nightgaunt in the distance! Alkmain readied his sword. Alkmain hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Alkmain pulls a cardinal potion from his pack and drinks it. He is reinvigorated. The nightgaunt struck with its claws! Alkmain the lion-hearted jumps out of the way. 

The inflated Alkmain sneaked around to nightgaunt's blind spot. The nightgaunt leans low, ready to strike with its might. 

He pulls a dark goldenrod potion from his pack and drinks it. He is reinvigorated. Alkmain lunged toward the nightgaunt, his sword ready to strike! The slippery nightgaunt evaded Alkmain's hit. 

The nightgaunt struck with its claws! Alkmain the bold jumps out of the way. Alkmain lunged toward the nightgaunt, his sword ready to strike! The shattering blow from Alkmain rumbled through the ground.

Alkmain says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Edmos was talking about."

## <a name="chapter15"></a> Chapter 15: Hiltown and the Stormghost

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Hiltown. A glazier bit into an apple. The sawyer finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a spearman. Alkmain continued down the path. Two bankers ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Tarchalikraterila.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a water carrier. Alkmain approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Hippus took over?" Alkmain asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

A lanternmaker finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Ipstont will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Gaua is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 7 small coins. "I want that Hippus gone as much as anybody."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. A pope bit into an apple. Two pioneers rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Gaua looked up from his work behind a counter at Alkmain.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Gaua grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of astomois and giant termites flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"Cunning hunters, stormghosts prowl lonely arctic tors, so named by their victims for their ability to conjure malignant weather and attack unseen. Stormghosts search constantly for food, tracking animals and intelligent creatures alike, and their appearances vary depending on the season, allowing them to blend into any environment. While stormghosts are thankfully rare, their regeneration mitigates the effects of aging, allowing them to live for more than 2,000 years. A typical stormghost stands 8 feet tall in its regular posture, but can extend its legs to reach up to 14 feet, with its muscled flesh and hardened chitin armor making it weigh roughly 1,500 pounds." Gaua explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the stormghost?" Alkmain asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Alkmain.

## <a name="chapter16"></a> Chapter 16: Sougby and the Jinushigami

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Sougby. While the spinster threw punches, a old-clothes dealer sat by the side of the road. The spice merchant ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Poin with a costermonger. Alkmain continued down the path. Nearby, a miller scuttled out of his way.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a rivener. Alkmain approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Hippus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Alkmain have come to destroy him!" Alkmain exclaimed.

While the charcoalburner threw punches, a basketmaker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a blockcutter. The man sat in silence for a whileHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Alkmain. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is into the market and towards the stables. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Ones Fine Supplies". You'll find Ones, the best weapons expert we've got. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 6 small coins. "I want that Hippus gone as much as anybody."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. Two bricklayers scuttled out of his way. Two princes gazed at him from an open window. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Ones looked up from his work behind a counter at Alkmain.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Ones grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of rakshasas and gelatinous cubes flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Guardians of significant natural wonders like mountains, large lakes, forests, and so on, jinushigami (known also as land kami) are the most powerful and revered of all kami, commanding the very forces of nature itself to ensure the safety and security of their wards. These potent spirits garner the most respect among other kami, wielding great influence over both them and the native creatures that dwell within their territories. Jinushigami tend to stay hidden amongst their land, however, knowing that their intimate tie with the environment makes them highly desirable targets among those who would seek to do harm to nature."

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Strangers to lands protected by jinushigami are well-advised to take the utmost care to not offend the powerful spirit creatures. When displeased, jinushigami can eradicate trails and warp the contours of their terrain, forcing travelers to endure unreasonable hardship in travel. These goliaths have little patience for those who would defile their efforts, and offenders who fail to listen to a jinushigami's initial hints quickly discover how devastating the kami's powers can be as they are forced from the land either by the lesser kami who serve their superior or by the towering jinushigami itself. Of course, those who respect and honor the jinushigami see the kami's other side, as the kami eases their travel by lessening undergrowth, shifting rivers, and otherwise providing subtle but incredible aid to travelers." Ones explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the jinushigami so bad?" Alkmain responded.

"Jinushigami are ancient and wise, and while they are no fools, they prefer to give visitors to their domains the benefit of the doubt. Only when an individual makes known his disruptive intentions toward the structure and cohesion of nature does a jinushigami react with violence. Of course, those who align themselves with naturally opposing forces of the kami, such as the oni, do not receive this friendly grace period, and a jinushigami can perceive most treacherous thoughts, sensing a suspicious visitor through its connection with the land, then tracking it down to stealthily observe it more closely." Ones explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the jinushigami?" Alkmain asked.

Ones returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A jinushigami is 38 feet tall and weighs over 30,000 pounds. When they manifest physical bodies, they appear as lumbering humanoid forms made of earth and stone and plant matter, sometimes with strange humanoid affectations like hats or jewelry."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the jinushigami so bad?" Alkmain responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Alkmain saw a ungodly jinushigami in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the beastly sight. Alkmain hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The jinushigami struck with its quarterstaff! The fierce blow from the monster narrowly misses our hero. The exhilarating combat made the hours seem like seconds. The jinushigami struck with its quarterstaff! The fierce blow from the monster narrowly misses he.

## <a name="chapter17"></a> Chapter 17: Wimbleyden and the Spirit Oni

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Wimbleyden. While the bard scuttled out of his way, a typefounder stood by a market stall, negotiating with the tinker. Two pardoners slept in an alleyway. Alkmain continued down the path. The plattner bit into an apple with a farrier.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a poet. The man, eying his unusual weapons, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Hippus took over?" Alkmain asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a brushbinder scuttled out of his way. He still looked suspiciousHe finally responded.

"Our village of Preet will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Pres is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the church and right. You'll see a inn. It's down the street to the barn and right. You'll see a barn. It's just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a tentsman gazed at him from an open window. The archer threw punches with a stewsman. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Pres looked up from his work behind a counter at Alkmain.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the saxra, or perhaps even the cave scorpion, but that's nothing compared to the spirit oni we've got."

Pres returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Most oni that emerge on the Material Plane do so into a new body of humanoid flesh, yet this is not the case for all oni. Periodically, when an evil spellcaster wishes to engage the servitude of an oni as a familiar, the result is something relatively unusual—an oni made flesh directly from its spiritual form rather than one who takes the features of a humanoid as its own."

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Pres returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Any lawful evil 7th-level spellcaster who takes the Improved Familiar feat can gain a spirit oni as a familiar. The ritual to gain such a familiar requires the spellcaster to craft a particularly fiendish and fierce-looking oni mask—this does not require a Craft check or any additional expenditure of gold, and is assumed to be part of the overall ritual for securing the familiar. When the ritual is complete a raw oni spirit is lured into the mask, which immediately transforms it into the animate, living creature presented here."

Alkmain slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

The armorer sighed and continued. "While the ritual binds the oni to its new master, it also robs the oni of its immediate chance to achieve a human form. As a result, spirit oni are foul-tempered and cantankerous creatures, even to their masters. They must be regularly reprimanded and disciplined, lest their jealousy and bitterness get the better of them. "

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Pres returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "When a spirit oni's master dies, the spirit oni gains free will and the ability to make its own choices—but the spirit oni's innate cowardice and dishonor usually prevents it from taking its own life in hopes of returning to true spirit form and then returning as a proper oni. Rather than extinguishing themselves, such masterless spirit oni seek out more powerful oni and offer their services to their superiors, in hopes that they might someday be granted a promotion from their lowly state to something more befitting their egos and desires."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the spirit oni?" Alkmain asked.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Alkmain saw a hideous spirit oni in the distance! He readied his sword. Alkmain hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter18"></a> Chapter 18: Marminnon Cirlastereston Dewtoketsbury Comber and the Sangoi

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Marminnon Cirlastereston Dewtoketsbury Comber. A harper sat by the side of the road. Nearby, a hay merchant finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Alkmain continued down the path. A playwright stood by a market stall, negotiating with the franklin.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a weeper. The man, eying his well-made boots, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Hippus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Alkmain have come to destroy him!" Alkmain exclaimed.

Nearby, a clothier ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Doneus. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Alkmain. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Amal is the best in town. His shop is past the stables. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Amal Fine Supplies". I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. The brazier slept in an alleyway with a mailmaker. A sexton slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Alkmain cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the ancient gold dragon, or perhaps even the fire beetle, but that's nothing compared to the sangoi we've got."

"Sometimes mistaken for vampires, sangois are evil nocturnal fey that haunt towns and graveyards, feeding on blood and hunting by the sounds of victims' hearts. They prefer humanoid blood but settle for animal blood when hungry." Amal explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the sangoi?" Alkmain asked.

"Sangoi stand 4 feet tall and weigh 35 to 40 pounds." Amal explained.

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Alkmain saw a dreadful sangoi in the distance! He readied his sword. Alkmain hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

He was victorious! The sangoi menaced for no longer! 

## <a name="chapter19"></a> Chapter 19: Lonellihulhamark and the Elephant

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Lonellihulhamark. Nearby, a thonger hawked fine imported goods from Southwickneterpood Gatephammell Grenham Hast. Two smelters slept in an alleyway. Alkmain continued down the path. Two doctors ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Beatus.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a harberdasher. Alkmain approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Hippus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Alkmain have come to destroy him!" Alkmain exclaimed.

Nearby, a poacher gazed at him from an open window. The man quietly reminised about the past, then finally responded.

"Our village of Higham will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is down the street to the warehouse and left. You'll see a inn. It's just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. You'll find Walet, the best weapons expert we've got. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. Two mirrorers scuttled out of his way. Nearby, a oyster raker loaded a market stall with wares. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Walet looked up from his work behind a counter at Alkmain.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Walet grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of girtablilus and leopards flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "These large land animals, majestically wandering the plains in tightly knit family herds, are symbols of wisdom and strength. Having few natural predators, elephants are sometimes hunted for their ivory tusks. These tusks often become jewelry, statuettes, and trinkets for the wealthy. "

Alkmain slipped the man 8 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Alkmain.

## <a name="chapter20"></a> Chapter 20: Easen and the Seps

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Easen. While the linenspinner bit into an apple, a mathematician rushed by quickly, ignoring him. A gluttonous fool loaded a market stall with wares. Alkmain continued down the path. The lighter man hawked fine imported goods from Eale with a scholar.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a fletcher. The man, eying his foreboding cloak, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Hippus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Alkmain have come to destroy him!" Alkmain exclaimed.

While the horner scuttled out of his way, a pattenmaker hawked fine imported goods from Newsbrith. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Alkmain. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Ibarrator is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the monastery and left. You'll see a church. It's past the warehouse. It's just to the right. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. Two old-clothes dealers stood by a market stall, negotiating with the roofer. While the tanner rushed by quickly, ignoring him, a minnesinger ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Polydos. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Alkmain cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the bodythief, or perhaps even the ogre spider, but that's nothing compared to the seps we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "A seps is an exotic snake-like creature whose powerful jaws contain acidic venom so potent that it quickly dissolves prey into liquid."

Alkmain slipped the man 2 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"An adult seps is 30 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds." Ibarrator explained.

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

## <a name="chapter21"></a> Chapter 21: Upnelda Valon-Sea and the Undigested Swarm

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Upnelda Valon-Sea. Nearby, a woolcomber slept in an alleyway. Nearby, a minnesinger slowly carried supplies. Alkmain continued down the path. While the saltboiler slept in an alleyway, a pattenmaker loaded a market stall with wares.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a draper. Alkmain approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Alkmain, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Hippus." Alkmain announced.

Nearby, a drayman finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The man sat in silence for a whileHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Alkmain. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Lewinus is into the market and towards the stables. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a chancellor bit into an apple. While the mercer rushed by quickly, ignoring him, a tanner scuttled out of his way. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Lewinus looked up from his work behind a counter at Alkmain.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Lewinus grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of medium air elementals and lampads flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Lewinus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Whereas individual undigested are more of a nuisance than a threat to adventurers, a swarm of such creatures can be dangerous to even experienced adventurers. An undigested swarm comprises hundreds of individual undigested. Driven by insatiable hunger, they fall upon and consume any living creatures crossing their path, surrounding the unfortunate victims and drenching them in acidic slime, digesting their still-living prey even before the screaming ends."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the undigested swarm so bad?" Alkmain responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Alkmain saw a mean undigested swarm in the distance! He readied his sword. Alkmain hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter22"></a> Chapter 22: Stockburt and the Catoblepas

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Stockburt. Nearby, a purse maker hawked fine imported goods from Wesburnal. A librarian finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Alkmain continued down the path. Two netmakers rushed by quickly, ignoring him.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a link man. Alkmain approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Hippus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Alkmain have come to destroy him!" Alkmain exclaimed.

Two bankers talked excitedly with what appeared to be a wine seller. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Widgwer will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Orabon is down the street to the tavern and left. You'll see a stables. It's down the street to the warehouse and left. You'll see a inn. It's past the monastery. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Orabon Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. Two paperers slowly carried supplies. Nearby, a dentist sat by the side of the road. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Alkmain cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the tizheruk, or perhaps even the water orm, but that's nothing compared to the catoblepas we've got."

Orabon returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The catoblepas is an aggressive beast at the best of times, willing to knock down trees, fences, even small houses to eat whatever it finds interesting, be that meal plant or animal or human being. Though it prefers swamps, the catoblepas has been known to forage in plains and forests for short periods before returning to the buoyant support of water and mud. Few creatures linger near a catoblepas's feeding ground because of the monster's bad temper and poisonous breath, and only rot-loving predators such as oozes or exceptionally large otyughs have any interest in hunting them."

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Orabon returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A catoblepas' primary motivation is hunting and exerting its dominance over lesser creatures in its territory. Easily detected by its foul odor, the creature tolerates the presence of wild animals, humanoid tribes, and even predators that it can bully as long as these things flee or act submissive when the poisonous brute lumbers into view. The catoblepas is known to engage in physical battles with other Large swamp creatures such as crocodiles or even froghemoths. Some humanoid tribes claim to know techniques to domesticate a catoblepas for use as a guard animal, but the monster's intractable nature and not insignificant intelligence almost certainly means magic is involved, as the creature has little need for alliances and can wipe out entire villages with its breath. Some have been known to use their breath underwater, creating a churning cloud of bubbles that kills fish in the area and starves out other creatures."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the catoblepas so bad?" Alkmain responded.

"A catoblepas's sense of smell is blunted by its own ungodly stench, and it can't easily recognize rival odors such as skunk musk (though this provides the beast no immunity to odor-based effects from other creatures)." Orabon explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the catoblepas so bad?" Alkmain responded.

Orabon returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A catoblepas is 15 feet long and weighs 2,200 pounds."

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Alkmain.

## <a name="chapter23"></a> Chapter 23: Norack and the Dire Polar Bear

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Norack. The harlot stood by a market stall, negotiating with the cannoneer with a apothecary. While the attendent hawked fine imported goods from Woolburton, a thimbler finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Alkmain continued down the path. The master of hounds eyed him suspiciously with a joiner.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a beekeeper. Alkmain approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Hippus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Alkmain have come to destroy him!" Alkmain exclaimed.

Two stonecutters gazed at him from an open window. He still looked suspiciousHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Alkmain. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Mecion is down the street to the warehouse and left. You'll see a cattle barn. It's down the street to the cattle barn and left. You'll see a inn. It's just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Mecion Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. The pardoner stood by a market stall, negotiating with the jeweler with a costermonger. The seamstress ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Frandyn with a palmer. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Mecion looked up from his work behind a counter at Alkmain.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Mecion grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of water leapers and plesiosauruss flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"Dire polar bears, kin to cave bears, are larger and more aggressive than cave bears and normal polar bears alike. These short-tempered animals tend to avoid settled regions, but sometimes venture dangerously close to them while hunting, potentially resulting in bloody massacres." Mecion explained.

Alkmain slipped the man 10 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

## <a name="chapter24"></a> Chapter 24: Hamwinal and the Hieracosphinx

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Hamwinal. A leadworker eyed him suspiciously. A baker scuttled out of his way. Alkmain continued down the path. The playwright stood by a market stall, negotiating with the siever with a cook.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a hobbler. The man, eying his dangerous demeanor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Hippus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Alkmain have come to destroy him!" Alkmain exclaimed.

A canaller talked excitedly with what appeared to be a fowler. The man eyed him thoughtfullyHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Alkmain. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Ctes is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 6 small coins. "I want that Hippus gone as much as anybody."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. Two shipwrights talked excitedly with what appeared to be a clockmaker. The rat catcher sat by the side of the road with a chancellor. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Alkmain cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Ctes grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of esipils and hungry fogs flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "The least intelligent of the common sphinxes, hieracosphinxes are a cowardly, cruel-hearted lot. All are male. They despise the larger and cleverer androsphinxes and criosphinxes. Toward gynosphinxes they hold a twisted mix of a lust and hate, simultaneously envying their beauty and power while craving them as mates. Hieracosphinxes attack other sphinxes whenever they have them at a disadvantage. Male sphinxes of other species they tear to shreds or drive away, whereas they prefer to leave gynosphinxes ravaged but alive. The other species of sphinx likewise hold nothing but disdain for hieracosphinxes, and typically attack these vile beasts on sight."

Alkmain slipped the man 8 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Hieracosphinxes guard their territory ruthlessly against weaker intruders, seldom giving warning before they attack. They have no use for banter and riddles, making most efforts at diplomacy rather ineffective, but can be convinced to call off their attacks by convincing shows of force coupled with information on the location of weaker prey or a gynosphinx. Though poor fliers, they still prefer to fight from the air, the better to escape if the combat turns against them."

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Ctes returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "As they lack the ego and resourcefulness of the rest of their breed, hieracosphinxes can be pressed into service of mounts, particularly by those of similarly evil dispositions. Hieracosphinxes chafe under such service but submit to more powerful riders, though they still inflict their foul tempers on any weaker creatures that happen by. A grown hieracosphinx can easily consume a full horse's worth of meat in a day, making their upkeep rather expensive. Even with these drawbacks, hieracosphinx eggs command values of up to 1,500 gp on the open market, as do young hieracosphinxes. It takes 3 years for a hieracosphinx to reach maturity, after which an untrained hieracosphinx only rarely accepts a rider without magical compulsion. Trainers, though hard to come by, charge thousands of gold pieces to rear and train a hieracosphinx, owing to the risk to life and limb."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the hieracosphinx?" Alkmain asked.

"A light load for a hieracosphinx is up to 350 pounds; a medium load, 351–700 pounds; and a heavy load, 701–1,050 pounds. A typical hieracosphinx is just short of 9 feet long and weighs 600 pounds.  Hieracosphinxes detest bearing a rider into battle, thus increasing the DCs of any combat-related Ride checks by +5. " Ctes explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the hieracosphinx so bad?" Alkmain responded.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

## <a name="chapter25"></a> Chapter 25: Soll and the Jubjub Bird

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Soll. Nearby, a pissprophet stood by a market stall, negotiating with the buffoon. While the nobleman finished an apple and tossed the core aside, a wheelwright talked excitedly with what appeared to be a hawker. Alkmain continued down the path. Two pot menders eyed him suspiciously.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a bodyservant. The man, eying his unusual weapons, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Alkmain, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Hippus." Alkmain announced.

A exchequer scuttled out of his way. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Bech will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is into the market and towards the tavern. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the monastery and right. You'll see a church. It's just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. You'll find Hremalricet, the best weapons expert we've got. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 5 small coins. "I want that Hippus gone as much as anybody."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. A chicken butcher bit into an apple. Two clockmakers bit into an apple. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Hremalricet looked up from his work behind a counter at Alkmain.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the ypotryll, or perhaps even the elder earth elemental, but that's nothing compared to the jubjub bird we've got."

"The jubjub bird is a rare and dangerous bird that resembles a giant dodo bird, but with long, muscular legs and wings that provide functional, if awkward, flight. When attacked with magic, a jubjub bird's plumage shifts randomly in hue and pattern with each spell hurled against it. " Hremalricet explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the jubjub bird so bad?" Alkmain responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Like the bandersnatch and other legendary creatures such as the jabberwock, the jubjub bird originally hails from the primal world of the fey. It has the dubious honor of being the least powerful and least intelligent of these creatures, which are known collectively as the "Tane," yet one should never assume that the jubjub bird is a pushover—its penchant for snapping off heads with its razor-sharp beak can quickly put such ideas to rest."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the jubjub bird?" Alkmain asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Powerful fey sometimes keep jubjub birds as guardians, and there are even reports of giants (particularly powerful tribes of jungle giants) using them as mounts. Such avian allies must be carefully trained, for few giants and fey are able to comfortably exist alongside a creature so prone to uttering such stunning shrieks so often."

Alkmain slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Hremalricet returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Jubjub birds stand about 20 feet tall and weigh roughly 6,000 pounds."

Alkmain slipped the man 2 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Hremalricet was talking about."

## <a name="chapter26"></a> Chapter 26: Ayledon-Tham and the Silvanshee

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Ayledon-Tham. While the minnesinger hawked fine imported goods from Isenbross Pad, a mariner bit into an apple. A guardsman talked excitedly with what appeared to be a tapestrymaker. Alkmain continued down the path. Two oilmakers scuttled out of his way.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a tentsman. Alkmain approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Alkmain, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Hippus." Alkmain announced.

The pavyler scuttled out of his way with a charcoalburner. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"Our village of And will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Ragart is the best in town. His shop is past the monastery. It's just to the left. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. The parish priest bit into an apple with a harper. A compasssmith loaded a market stall with wares. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Alkmain cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the elder air elemental, or perhaps even the ram, but that's nothing compared to the silvanshee we've got."

"Silvanshees are curious but reclusive cat agathions. Unobtrusive and able to blend in among normal animals (unlike the more anthropomorphic agathions), they are the eyes and ears of the good planes in the mortal world. Most roam hills, forests, and plains, keeping an eye out for evil influences. They can be taken as familiars by 7th-level good spellcasters who utilize the Improved Familiar feat and meet the proper prerequisites. As familiars, silvanshees act as moral guides and steer their mortal allies toward corruptive forces that must be eliminated. In some mortal lands, they are called cat sìth or cath sidhe, and are believed to be disguised witches or fairies—and not necessarily benign creatures, which only encourages silvanshees to avoid strangers." Ragart explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the silvanshee so bad?" Alkmain responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Silvanshees are not fond of open combat, even against demons, devils, or other fiendish threats, and they're likely to run away if confronted. When they must fight, they prefer greater numbers and the element of surprise, using their magic to temporarily overcome their physical weaknesses, and melting away into mist if the battle turns against them."

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "A silvanshee is the size of a large domestic cat, though almost always sleek rather than fat, and weighs 20 pounds on average."

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Alkmain saw a unkind silvanshee in the distance! He readied his sword. Alkmain hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Alkmain lunged toward the silvanshee, his sword ready to strike! A sharp crack was heard as the strike left its mark. The monster was stunned by the attack. The epic Alkmain pulls a pastel purple potion from his pack and drinks it. He is reinvigorated.

Alkmain says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Ragart was talking about."

## <a name="chapter27"></a> Chapter 27: Ell and the Putrid Ooze

Alkmain followed a dirt path into the village of Ell. The drycooper slept in an alleyway with a mathematician. A cardmaker finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Alkmain continued down the path. A pot mender scuttled out of his way.

Eventually, Alkmain arrived at the town square, where he found a cartier. The man, eying his impressive armor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Hippus took over?" Alkmain asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

The fruitier finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a poet. The man quietly reminised about the past, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Alkmain. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is down the street to the inn and left. You'll see a monastery. It's down the street to the barn and left. You'll see a tavern. It's into the market and towards the inn. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the monastery. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the barn and right. You'll see a tavern. It's into the market and towards the warehouse. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the inn and left. You'll see a inn. It's down the street to the cattle barn and left. You'll see a tavern. It's just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. You'll find Johun, the best weapons expert we've got. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Alkmain hurried towards the armory. While the canon threw punches, a thonger loaded a market stall with wares. The mercer rushed by quickly, ignoring him with a dyer. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Johun looked up from his work behind a counter at Alkmain.

"I'm Alkmain, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Hippus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Johun lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The putrid ooze."

"Putrid oozes are primarily made from organic mire animated with Abyssal energies. These creatures can exist near any rift or portal to the Abyss. They caustically burn through plants and animals in pursuit of their vicious, mindless hunger. Putrid oozes get their name from their disturbing habit of subsuming dead creatures into their own gelatinous bodies. Putrid oozes generally are a combination of churning, gray-and-black slurries, similar to chunky tar mixed with wet gravel, but their bodies also hold undigested portions of the creatures they consume. At any one time, they present a mixture of rotting limbs, severed heads, and entangled entrails among the miscellaneous sludge that makes up their bodies." Johun explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the putrid ooze?" Alkmain asked.

Johun returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Most hardy materials putrid oozes consume are never completely devoured. Putrid oozes slowly break down their meals into the same gray-black, chunky morass that makes up their bodies. Although it's rare for a putrid ooze to starve, those weakening from hunger use the last of their dwindling energy to seek out chasms or ravines where they can lie in wait, hoping for meals to wander past. In these dark places, the putrid oozes go dormant, existing as murky pools of sticky acid until a living creature draws near. Though the creatures are essentially in hibernation, all it takes is a simple touch to awaken them. In contrast, active putrid oozes are intimidating sights to behold, and rarely take anyone by surprise."

Alkmain looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Unlike other oozes, putrid oozes don't reproduce via mitosis—splitting into two identical, smaller oozes. Instead, they form spontaneously from corrupted rifts to the Abyss. Some cultists of Jubilex, demon lord of ooze monsters, have experimented with generating putrid oozes by exposing slurries of entrails, filth, and acid to foul energies. They see the spontaneous creation of these oozes as manifestations of the Faceless Lord."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the putrid ooze?" Alkmain asked.

"When putrid oozes take enough damage to be destroyed, they melt into an inert pool of muck like most other oozes, though whether putrid oozes eventually reform from such remnants is a point of debate. Some say that sunlight further breaks down putrid oozes once they are destroyed." Johun explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the putrid ooze so bad?" Alkmain responded.

Johun returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A putrid ooze typically covers an area that measures 12 feet by 12 feet, and piles up on itself to a height of no more than 8 feet. A putrid ooze weighs about 20 tons."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the putrid ooze?" Alkmain asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Alkmain.
