[This is the link text](#chapter5)



## <a name="chapter1"></a> Chapter 1: Ken and the Baboon

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Ken. The merchant taylor slept in an alleyway with a lacemaker. Two papermakers finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Sumantes continued down the path. The bather talked excitedly with what appeared to be a executioner with a brushbinder.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a tillerman. Sumantes approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Euryllus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Sumantes have come to destroy him!" Sumantes exclaimed.

While the fence talked excitedly with what appeared to be a besom maker, a bather gazed at him from an open window. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Bedospood will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Imbal is into the market and towards the warehouse. Eventually you need to walk past the warehouse. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. The gardner eyed him suspiciously with a poet. Nearby, a maidservant rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Imbal looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Imbal lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The baboon."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Baboons are known for their aggressive nature and distinctive build, including a canine-like maw filled with sharp teeth, strong jaw muscles, a short tail, and prominent calluses on their brightly colored and protruding buttocks. Though they are primarily vegetarians, baboons are known to eat fish, insects, shellfish, and other small creatures. Ferociously territorial, baboons are quick to rise and defend their homes from any sort of intruders."

Sumantes slipped the man 2 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

The armorer sighed and continued. "A baboon is 3 feet tall and weighs 70 pounds."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the baboon so bad?" Sumantes responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Sumantes saw a terrifying baboon in the distance! Sumantes the grandioseour hero readied his sword. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Sumantes lunged toward the baboon, his sword ready to strike! The slippery baboon evaded Sumantes's hit. The monster was stunned by the attack. He pulls a dark lavender potion from his pack and drinks it. He is reinvigorated. 

The baboon leans low, ready to strike with its might. Sumantes lunged toward the baboon, his sword ready to strike! The baboon took a glancing blow. 

The baboon struck with its bite! The adventurer jumps out of the way. Sumantes lunged toward the baboon, his sword ready to strike! The slippery baboon evaded Sumantes's hit.

## <a name="chapter2"></a> Chapter 2: Scus and the Sea Drake

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Scus. Two spicers talked excitedly with what appeared to be a tinker. A sexton rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Sumantes continued down the path. Nearby, a prince rushed by quickly, ignoring him.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a waterseller. Sumantes approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Sumantes, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Euryllus." Sumantes announced.

A sapper threw punches. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Shrioney Lane will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Aman is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the stables. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. A fool for money rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Two princes finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Sumantes cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Aman lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The sea drake."

Aman returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "While obviously the product of draconic inbreeding, the heritage of sea drakes is less clear than that of other drakes. Among the strongest of the drakes, sea drakes still lack the mental acuity of their true dragon forebears, though they remain as brutally cunning as other drakes. Although amphibious, sea drakes spend the majority of their time in shallow coastal waters."

Sumantes slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Aman returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Sea drakes are up to 14 feet long from their noses to the tips of their powerful tails. They weigh 2,000 pounds."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the sea drake?" Sumantes asked.

Aman returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The most solitary of all drakes, sea drakes prefer to hunt alone. Occasionally, however, they band together in packs to hunt larger prey. Such rampages can be a significant danger to coastal shipping."

Sumantes slipped the man 8 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

Sumantes saw a terrifying sea drake in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the eerie sight. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The sea drake struck with its bite! He jumps out of the way. Sumantes lunged toward the sea drake, his sword ready to strike! The slippery sea drake evaded Sumantes's hit.

## <a name="chapter3"></a> Chapter 3: Osgatfortinchley and the Pale Stranger

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Osgatfortinchley. A parchmenter talked excitedly with what appeared to be a musician. Two chandlers finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Sumantes continued down the path. Nearby, a copyist sat by the side of the road.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a mathematician. Sumantes approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Sumantes, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Euryllus." Sumantes announced.

While the poacher slowly carried supplies, a buttonmaker bit into an apple. The man quietly reminised about the past, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Eal will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Percianus is the best in town. His shop is past the stables. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Percianus Fine Supplies". And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 4 small coins. "I want that Euryllus gone as much as anybody."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. Two nedellers eyed him suspiciously. The hurdle maker gazed at him from an open window with a bishop. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Percianus looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Percianus lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The pale stranger."

"Sometimes death itself cannot come between a gunslinger and its final revenge. When a gunslinger is slain by a hated enemy, or murdered before it can achieve vengeance against a hated foe, the anger and wrath can animate its remains as a vengeful undead monstrosity. When a pale stranger first rises, it seeks out the source of its anger to finish the job—thereafter, it wanders the desolate parts of the world looking for new victims to vent its unending rage upon." Percianus explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the pale stranger so bad?" Sumantes responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "A pale stranger appears much as it did in life, though desiccated and obviously undead. Rare pale strangers have the ability to hide their undead nature and appear as they did in life using veil as a constant spell-like ability (CL equals their CR). These pale strangers are often more powerful and have class levels in gunslinger or ranger, and often attract large groups of adoring bandits and followers who may or may not realize that their murderous idol is in fact an unliving horror."

Sumantes slipped the man 5 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Percianus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A pale stranger stands 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs 130 pounds."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"That's all I can tell you."

Sumantes saw a ungodly pale stranger in the distance! The fire-eating Sumantes readied his sword. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Percianus was talking about."

## <a name="chapter4"></a> Chapter 4: Pings and the Einherji

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Pings. The beer seller gazed at him from an open window with a hunter. While the harness maker gazed at him from an open window, a pioneer hawked fine imported goods from Sounte. Sumantes continued down the path. While the privycleaner slowly carried supplies, a silversmith slept in an alleyway.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a glass seller. Sumantes approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Sumantes, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Euryllus." Sumantes announced.

Two laundresss rushed by quickly, ignoring him. He still looked suspiciousHe finally responded.

"Our village of Easton will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Denisius is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the tavern. Eventually you need to walk past the stables. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Denisius Fine Supplies". I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a jailer ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Iban. A privycleaner slept in an alleyway. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Denisius looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Denisius lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The einherji."

Denisius returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Some warriors who die glorious deaths in battle find that there is a call for their skill and prowess even after death. Chosen by valkyries from among the slain on the battlefield, they become einherjar, outsiders who fight for the gods and other powerful extraplanar beings in battles across the multiverse."

Sumantes slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Like valkyries, einherjar can serve a variety of deities, not just gods of war, conflict, and valor, but also those of love, beauty, life, and others not thought of as combative. Einherjar pride themselves on prowess in battle, and forever seek to prove themselves by challenging worthy foes."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Einherjar can be either male or female, and normally appear as muscled, battle-hardened humans, dwarves, or elves. A typical einherji stands 7 feet tall and weighs around 300 pounds."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the einherji?" Sumantes asked.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Sumantes saw a smelly einherji in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the horrendous sight. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Denisius was talking about."

## <a name="chapter5"></a> Chapter 5: Houth and the Etiainen

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Houth. While the cabinetmaker rushed by quickly, ignoring him, a diplomat eyed him suspiciously. Two beggers talked excitedly with what appeared to be a engraver. Sumantes continued down the path. While the barrister scuttled out of his way, a sea captain bit into an apple.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a hatter. The man, eying his determined look, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Euryllus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Sumantes have come to destroy him!" Sumantes exclaimed.

Nearby, a lighter man ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Raaf. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Sumantes. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is into the market and towards the stables. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the monastery. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. You'll find Gimm, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. A philosopher talked excitedly with what appeared to be a nedeller. Two barkers slept in an alleyway. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Sumantes cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the sea hag, or perhaps even the werebear (human form), but that's nothing compared to the etiainen we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Etiainens are psychic amalgams of the past and the future, given form in a wispy, indistinct shape. It is believed these spirits are projections of strong psychic emanations from the past—usually the echoes of important people or the psychic residue of heroic deeds—and that they can manifest only in the presence of the psychic impressions and energies that attend the living. Once manifested, etiainens often act in confusing or even whimsical ways, opening and closing doors, attacking and stealing memories of those nearby, and creating a general sense of psychic discontent. They continue either until compelled to stop or until they use enough of their psychic magic to wink out of existence for a short period of time, returning only when the psychic impressions and energy of the local area allow them to manifest once again to repeat the cycle."

Sumantes slipped the man 10 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

The armorer sighed and continued. "An etiainen sometimes forges an involuntary connection with a creature that allows the spirit to perform actions in advance of the linked creature, leading to bizarre cases of deja vu for those nearby. For instance, a husband might hear the front door open and the sound of his wife's familiar footsteps walking toward him, only to discover that his wife has not yet returned home—But bafflingly, when she does come home, she carries out the same series of actions."

Sumantes slipped the man 8 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Gimm returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Those who manage to successfully communicate with etiainens can sometimes compel the spirits to perform small tasks, though holding their attention requires great patience. For one who manages this difficult task, these spirits can sometimes act as intermediaries and messengers, or even spies. When acting in this fashion, an etiainen often appears as a strange, silent double of the creature it is serving. Etiainens can understand speech but cannot speak, and they rely on mindlink to communicate. Because of the chaotic nature of these spirits, such fellowships are short lived, as the etiainen might at any time flit away on some strange flight of fancy."

Sumantes slipped the man 5 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Sumantes.

Sumantes saw a scary etiainen in the distance! The adventurer readied his sword. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The etiainen leans low, ready to strike with its might. Sumantes lunged toward the etiainen, his sword ready to strike! The slippery etiainen evaded Sumantes's hit.

Sumantes says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Gimm was talking about."

## <a name="chapter6"></a> Chapter 6: Duncasterpooll Hildurban and the Dullahan

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Duncasterpooll Hildurban. Two mailmakers ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Alaskuin. Nearby, a mapmaker stood by a market stall, negotiating with the spicer. Sumantes continued down the path. Nearby, a lapidary hawked fine imported goods from Crow.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a minnesinger. Sumantes approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Euryllus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Sumantes have come to destroy him!" Sumantes exclaimed.

A balancemaker bit into an apple. The man eyed him thoughtfully, then finally responded.

"Our village of Maine will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Esder is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Esder Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 6 small coins. "I want that Euryllus gone as much as anybody."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. The pope talked excitedly with what appeared to be a chantry priest with a palmer. Two lanternmakers rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Sumantes cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the giant termite, or perhaps even the raktavarna, but that's nothing compared to the dullahan we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Terrifying reapers of souls, dullahans are created by powerful fiends from the souls of particularly cruel generals, watch-captains, or other military commanders. Sent back from the pits of Hell to sow terror and harvest new souls, dullahans return to the towns or villages they lived in as mortals. While their favored victims are evil men and women (or their living descendants) whose souls are destined for Hell, the dullahans have no qualms about adding innocents to their lists of victims."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the dullahan?" Sumantes asked.

"Legends tell of powerful dullahans who can summon not just a single fiendish mount, but an entire carriage pulled by six powerful ebony horses. Known as a "Coach of the Silent," these powerful undead are CR 14 with 20 Hit Dice, the advanced creature simple template, and the ability to cast trap the soul on those who fail to resist their death's calling. These souls take seats in the coach, where they languish forever—or at least until the dullahan himself is slain. " Esder explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the dullahan so bad?" Sumantes responded.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Sumantes.

Sumantes saw a horrendous dullahan in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the awful sight. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The dullahan struck with its keen longsword! The gruesome dullahan failed to land its hit. Sumantes lunged toward the dullahan, his sword ready to strike! The dullahan was struck by the blow!

## <a name="chapter7"></a> Chapter 7: Houth Rush and the Giant Locust

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Houth Rush. The wattler stood by a market stall, negotiating with the lutemaker with a beerbrewer. While the sea captain threw punches, a lighter man gazed at him from an open window. Sumantes continued down the path. Nearby, a sailmaker eyed him suspiciously.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a typefounder. Sumantes approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Euryllus took over?" Sumantes asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

The spearman slowly carried supplies with a farmer. The man quietly reminised about the past, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Sumantes. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is into the market and towards the cattle barn. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the inn and right. You'll see a cattle barn. It's into the market and towards the cattle barn. Eventually you need to walk past the church. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Orion Fine Supplies". You'll find Orion, the best weapons expert we've got. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. A swineherd gazed at him from an open window. Two harness makers gazed at him from an open window. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Sumantes cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Orion lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The giant locust."

"Giant locusts have a hunger akin to their smaller cousins, but only rarely do they gather in the endless numbers of their tiny kin." Orion explained.

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Orion returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A mature giant locust measures just over 4 feet long and weighs 50 pounds."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the giant locust so bad?" Sumantes responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Sumantes saw a loathsome giant locust in the distance! He readied his sword. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter8"></a> Chapter 8: Manchurhampian and the Choral

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Manchurhampian. Two camp followers scuttled out of his way. Two seneschals threw punches. Sumantes continued down the path. While the nobleman threw punches, a founder slowly carried supplies.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a dean. The man, eying his dangerous demeanor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Euryllus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Sumantes have come to destroy him!" Sumantes exclaimed.

Nearby, a pewterer talked excitedly with what appeared to be a chamberlain. The man quietly reminised about the pastHe finally responded.

"Our village of Sea will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Nikas is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. While the lady hawked fine imported goods from Neath, a mailmaker slowly carried supplies. The jester ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Eulos with a canaller. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Sumantes cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Nikas grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of medium earth elementals and stringy demodands flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"Choral angels are singers of great skill, and their ranks fill the halls of good deities with soaring hymns and solemn chants. They manifest from the spirits of the pious dead who had exceptional musical talent. While they aren't soldiers, chorals can defend themselves with their magical voices. Chorals sometimes visit the Material Plane with auspicious messages for mortals." Nikas explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the choral so bad?" Sumantes responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Sumantes saw a abominable choral in the distance! He readied his sword. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter9"></a> Chapter 9: Canas and the Deathweb

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Canas. A tinker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a fruitier. While the weirkeeper slept in an alleyway, a wetnurse eyed him suspiciously. Sumantes continued down the path. While the chainmaker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a tumbler, a philosopher talked excitedly with what appeared to be a milliner.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a hobbler. The man, eying his impressive armor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Sumantes, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Euryllus." Sumantes announced.

Nearby, a drayman loaded a market stall with wares. The man eyed him thoughtfullyHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Sumantes. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Urai is down the street to the stables and right. You'll see a tavern. It's just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. While the pinmaker rushed by quickly, ignoring him, a maid loaded a market stall with wares. The wood seller threw punches with a quarryman. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Sumantes cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Urai grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of mummy lords and vampires flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "A deathweb is the undead exoskeleton of a massive spider animated with the vilest necromancy. The spells that create this monstrosity bind to it thousands of normal spiders, which together form the mind of the undead beast like an arachnid hive. These smaller spiders live in and direct their exoskeleton home, working together to swarm around the deathweb and weave its web sheets."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Urai returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The exoskeleton of a deathweb is cracked and full of holes to allow the resident spiders easy passage into and out of it. Although the exoskeleton can be up to 10 feet long, the largest spiders within are only 6 inches in length. The variety in the sizes of the internal spiders allows them to ably move all parts of the exoskeleton, giving the massive carapace amazing dexterity and swiftness, as well as cleverness, perception, and presence."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Urai returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "These capabilities make deathwebs resourceful and frightening opponents, especially when adversaries mistake them for normal monstrous arachnids or mindless undead. Because of their ability to squeeze into tight surroundings, deathwebs may be found lurking in all manner of niches."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Deathwebs lair where they can build webs to trap passersby, such as among thick trees or in caves or tunnels. The creatures don't actively collect valuables, but they kill indiscriminately to feed the multitude of spiders within. Webs in a deathweb's lair are thus likely to contain valuables despite the creature's lack of interest in wealth."

Sumantes slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Sumantes.

Sumantes saw a horrendous deathweb in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the lousy sight. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Sumantes lunged toward the deathweb, his sword ready to strike! The slippery deathweb evaded Sumantes's hit. The monster was stunned by the attack. Sumantes lunged toward the deathweb, his sword ready to strike! The slippery deathweb evaded Sumantes's hit.

## <a name="chapter10"></a> Chapter 10: Sterreedsenhend and the Xtabay

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Sterreedsenhend. While the shepherd eyed him suspiciously, a girdler slept in an alleyway. Nearby, a panter eyed him suspiciously. Sumantes continued down the path. Nearby, a gunstocker rushed by quickly, ignoring him.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a summoner. Sumantes approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Euryllus took over?" Sumantes asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Two parchmenters stood by a market stall, negotiating with the shoemaker. The man quietly reminised about the past, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Sumantes. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Gusse is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the monastery and left. You'll see a tavern. It's past the monastery. It's just to the left. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a girdler slowly carried supplies. Two scholars talked excitedly with what appeared to be a baker. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Gusse looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Gusse grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of achaierais and bodaks flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Known for their potent—and ultimately deadly—scent, xtabays are a floral hazard to the unwary. As fast-spreading as ivy, a xtabay's vines are sturdy and adaptive, making the plant a potential threat nearly everywhere—from gardens to wells to forest groves."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the xtabay?" Sumantes asked.

Gusse returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Attractive flowers blossom from the vines of xtabays, emitting the spores that mean a slow death for their victims. The strange, face-like patterns that grow on the petals are disturbing but seem to have no real function. Hermits or other reclusive types have been known to surround their territory with xtabays, warding off pesky creatures and adventurers alike. Instances of xtabays of larger-than-usual size have also been reported. These massive plants possess tendrils as thick as tree limbs and flowers that can fell even the hardiest of warriors with their overwhelming perfume. Underground, xtabays thrive in the wet, dark environment, covering the walls and floors of entire caverns and anesthetizing whole dens of subterranean creatures."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Nomadic plants, xtabays traverse large expanses of land until they sense nearby life, at which point they lie dormant and take on the guise of harmless flowers while releasing their deceptive aroma. Once a creature is subdued, the beast-like plant wastes no time in devouring it, disregarding creatures unaffected by its aroma. Because of their carnivorous nature, xtabays only rarely run short on nutrients, consuming the entirety of a victim's body over the course of several days following the initial process of draining its blood. Xtabays are able to devour creatures thanks to their lengthy roots, which produce a corrosive acid that breaks down and absorbs flesh and bone." Gusse explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the xtabay?" Sumantes asked.

"That's all I can tell you."

Sumantes saw a fearful xtabay in the distance! The high-flown Sumantes readied his sword. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The xtabay struck with its stings! Sumantes winces from the pain but continues fighting. He leaned on his sword to catch a moment's respite. He was worn out by the combat. The xtabay leans low, ready to strike with its might. 

The xtabay struck with its stings! Sumantes reeled back in pain. Sumantes lunged toward the xtabay, his sword ready to strike! The slippery xtabay evaded Sumantes's hit. 

He sneaked around to xtabay's blind spot. Sumantes lunged toward the xtabay, his sword ready to strike! The slippery xtabay evaded Sumantes's hit.

Sumantes says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Gusse was talking about."

## <a name="chapter11"></a> Chapter 11: RÃ³menharenhalonet and the Monadic Deva

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of RÃ³menharenhalonet. While the chancellor stood by a market stall, negotiating with the waterman, a brushbinder eyed him suspiciously. A buckle maker scuttled out of his way. Sumantes continued down the path. Nearby, a girdler gazed at him from an open window.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a engraver. The man, eying his strong forearms, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Sumantes, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Euryllus." Sumantes announced.

A diplomat bit into an apple. The man quietly reminised about the past, then finally responded.

"Our village of Gillip Gard will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Ditman is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the barn and right. You'll see a monastery. It's into the market and towards the inn. Eventually you need to walk past the tavern. It's just to the right. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. While the priest slept in an alleyway, a beekeeper hawked fine imported goods from Embley Whighborock. While the monk gazed at him from an open window, a monk scuttled out of his way. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Ditman looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the kodama, or perhaps even the bone golem, but that's nothing compared to the monadic deva we've got."

Ditman returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Monadic devas are stoic watchers of the Ethereal Plane and the Elemental Planes. They search those planes for fiendish enclaves, battle evil planar monsters such as xills, and act as celestial liaisons to the genies and elementals. They have been known to broker temporary peace between warring elemental factions, often using their inherent magic to end hostilities long enough for negotiations to take place. In the armies of the good planes, they are leaders and officers, and after centuries of service to a deity, they may be transformed into astral devas."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Monadic devas like giving their maces names and proudly announcing them in battle with evil foes. Many of these weapons have seen battle for thousands of years and are quite battered. Younger devas may lend their weapons to good churches on the Material Plane so they can be used by great mortal heroes, though the angels eventually reclaim them after no more than a year and a day." Ditman explained.

Sumantes slipped the man 2 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

The armorer sighed and continued. "A monadic deva is 7 feet tall and weighs 220 pounds."

Sumantes slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

Sumantes saw a beastly monadic deva in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the detestable sight. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

Sumantes says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Ditman was talking about."

## <a name="chapter12"></a> Chapter 12: Glow and the Spectre

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Glow. The quartermaster slowly carried supplies with a executioner. Nearby, a scrivener bit into an apple. Sumantes continued down the path. A turner sat by the side of the road.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a pardoner. The man, eying his foreboding cloak, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Euryllus took over?" Sumantes asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

While the pavior talked excitedly with what appeared to be a saltboiler, a quarryman threw punches. He still looked suspicious, then finally responded.

"Our village of Warnest will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is down the street to the barn and right. You'll see a tavern. It's down the street to the monastery and right. You'll see a barn. It's just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Aethuelippomes Fine Supplies". You'll find Aethuelippomes, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. A huntsman scuttled out of his way. While the fabricshearer gazed at him from an open window, a crofter stood by a market stall, negotiating with the skinner. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Aethuelippomes looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Aethuelippomes grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of crucidaemons and pixies flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Spectres are evil undead that hate sunlight and living things. Most are the remnants of murdered or evil humans, their anger preventing them from entering the afterlife. Like ghosts, spectres haunt the places of their deaths, and seek to draw others into the lonely abyss of undeath."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the spectre?" Sumantes asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "A spectre looks much as it did in life and can be easily recognized by those who knew the individual or have seen the individual's face in paintings or drawings. Spectres retain a strong sense of identity, and even ancient, insane spectres generally remain coherent. Evil historians and necromancers often try to ally with spectres for the knowledge they held in life and retain in undeath."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"That's all I can tell you."

Sumantes saw a horrendous spectre in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the fearful sight. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

He sneaked around to spectre's blind spot. The spectre struck with its incorporeal touch! The abhorrent spectre failed to land its hit.

## <a name="chapter13"></a> Chapter 13: Brown and the Astradaemon

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Brown. Two shinglers talked excitedly with what appeared to be a poacher. Two woodcarvers hawked fine imported goods from Mingort. Sumantes continued down the path. Nearby, a terrazo grinder slept in an alleyway.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a summoner. Sumantes approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Sumantes, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Euryllus." Sumantes announced.

A ferryman bit into an apple. He still looked suspicious, then finally responded.

"Our village of Leich will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. You'll find Alec, the best weapons expert we've got. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a spinster loaded a market stall with wares. Two fresco painters slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Alec looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the minotaur, or perhaps even the tendriculos, but that's nothing compared to the astradaemon we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Believed to be creations of the Four Horsemen, astradaemons live out their existence in search of souls to harvest. These deadly creatures are ravening planar predators, openly hunting throughout the void for souls on which to feed. These voracious creatures are the personifications of death resulting from negative energy or level drain. Their vile touch drains life force from their enemies, and even perishing near them sates their thirst for life and souls. "

Sumantes slipped the man 2 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

Sumantes saw a menacing astradaemon in the distance! He readied his sword. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter14"></a> Chapter 14: Crow Royamblesmorton Par and the Hellcat

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Crow Royamblesmorton Par. Two cutlers loaded a market stall with wares. The stonecutter eyed him suspiciously with a plattner. Sumantes continued down the path. Nearby, a maid sat by the side of the road.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a nun. The man, eying his determined look, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Euryllus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Sumantes have come to destroy him!" Sumantes exclaimed.

A sailor rushed by quickly, ignoring him. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"Our village of Grins Ders Huld Corieldge Harbrislest-ing will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Ailmyn is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 2 small coins. "I want that Euryllus gone as much as anybody."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. The pikeman gazed at him from an open window with a bellfounder. While the hobbler slept in an alleyway, a groom rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Ailmyn looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Ailmyn lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The hellcat."

"The hellcat is a devious predator native to the fiery pits of Hell. While the hellcat is not a devil itself, it often acts as a guardian or mount for devils. Some might assume that hellcats serve devils as pets, but since hellcats are as intelligent as humans, they take offense to the idea that they might be anyone's pet." Ailmyn explained.

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"On its own, a hellcat prefers to spend its time hunting and stalking prey. While the hellcat, as an outsider, need not eat to survive, it does enjoy eating for pleasure, often leaving significant portions of its kills behind for others to find. A hellcat that enters into an alliance with a devil is often used as a sort of hunter as a result. Human mortals can use spells like planar ally or planar binding to conjure hellcats for similar purposes. Those who do so are well advised to treat the hellcat with respect, for should any master prove too haughty with his hellcat or treat it as a dumb animal, the hellcat nurtures a lasting grudge. In such instances, the hellcat goes to great lengths to plan and coordinate revenge on the spellcaster, hoping to satisfy its own pride and to provide a lesson and example to all those who would deal with their kind." Ailmyn explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the hellcat?" Sumantes asked.

"Though incapable of speech themselves, hellcats understand the Infernal tongue of their home plane, and can communicate by telepathy with any creature capable of speech. Hellcats are quick to retreat if they are clearly overmatched or up against foes they cannot reach, but they never forget prey that escapes them, and will often track potential victims and try to lead allies (including other hellcats) to them in order to make coordinated attacks or ambushes." Ailmyn explained.

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"The hellcat is only clearly visible in dim light, at these times appearing as a skeletal dire tiger with hellish flames burning and flickering along the surface of its bones. Despite this eerie appearance, the hellcat is neither undead nor an elemental creature. The "fires" are actually its blood coursing through transparent flesh. In bright light, the hellcat's entire body fades away into obscurity, while in darkness its glowing blood is muted. " Ailmyn explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the hellcat so bad?" Sumantes responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Hellcats are as large as tigers, measuring 9 feet long and weighing 900 pounds."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"That's all I can tell you."

Sumantes saw a mean hellcat in the distance! He readied his sword. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter15"></a> Chapter 15: Stamin-th and the Horn Caterpillar

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Stamin-th. The privycleaner ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Menolitus with a shingler. The potboy loaded a market stall with wares with a plattner. Sumantes continued down the path. Nearby, a goldsmith stood by a market stall, negotiating with the combmaker.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a miner. The man, eying his strong forearms, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Sumantes, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Euryllus." Sumantes announced.

A mosaic layer rushed by quickly, ignoring him. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Watforpornembark will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Aesce is the best in town. His shop is past the stables. There's a small door. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. A wheelwright loaded a market stall with wares. The bodger eyed him suspiciously with a chaplain. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Sumantes cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Aesce lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The horn caterpillar."

Aesce returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Unlike normal caterpillars, voracious giant horn caterpillars don't pupate into butterflies. Instead, they remain in their worm-like forms for their entire life cycle, growing between each molt until they eventually reach the size of large dogs."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Horn caterpillars feed on the hooves and horns of dead ungulates, which they usually scavenge from corpses. Their sharp mandibles allow them to effortlessly shear through tendon and bone." Aesce explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the horn caterpillar so bad?" Sumantes responded.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Sumantes saw a ruinous horn caterpillar in the distance! He readied his sword. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

Sumantes says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Aesce was talking about."

## <a name="chapter16"></a> Chapter 16: Water Easte and the Megalania

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Water Easte. While the founder stood by a market stall, negotiating with the fool, a gemcutter threw punches. Two ragpickers slowly carried supplies. Sumantes continued down the path. Nearby, a brewer ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Aimesias.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a diplomat. The man, eying his dangerous demeanor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Sumantes, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Euryllus." Sumantes announced.

While the glasspainter rushed by quickly, ignoring him, a lawyer rushed by quickly, ignoring him. The man quietly reminised about the past, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Sumantes. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Alkie is down the street to the barn and right. You'll see a church. It's into the market and towards the church. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 3 small coins. "I want that Euryllus gone as much as anybody."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. While the skinner slept in an alleyway, a parker bit into an apple. Two lacemakers bit into an apple. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Alkie looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Alkie grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of aghasuras and flytrap leshys flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"The immense megalania is often mistaken for a dragon or dinosaur. Certainly the lizard's aggressive attitude and deep, rumbling roars only encourage such misidentifications. Large enough to catch and eat rhinos and elephants, a megalania prefers hunting much smaller prey that it can gulp down in one greedy swallow. Humanoids are among its favorite meals. " Alkie explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the megalania?" Sumantes asked.

Alkie returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A megalania is 20 feet long and weighs 2,000 pounds."

Sumantes slipped the man 10 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Sumantes saw a scandalous megalania in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the sickie sight. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter17"></a> Chapter 17: Uxbrincand and the Coloxus

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Uxbrincand. The chantry priest bit into an apple with a dyer. Two merchant taylors sat by the side of the road. Sumantes continued down the path. Nearby, a woolcomber rushed by quickly, ignoring him.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a emperor. The man, eying his dangerous demeanor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Sumantes, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Euryllus." Sumantes announced.

Nearby, a stewsman threw punches. The man eyed him thoughtfully, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Sumantes. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Chlodo is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the warehouse and right. You'll see a warehouse. It's past the warehouse. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Chlodo Fine Supplies". Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. While the engineer rushed by quickly, ignoring him, a swordsmith loaded a market stall with wares. Nearby, a peasant loaded a market stall with wares. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Chlodo looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Chlodo grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of giant skunks and emotion oozes flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Coloxus demons, known also as fly demons, resemble humans with the head of a fly and twin pairs of gossamer wings. Even their smallest movements and gestures seem infused with manic quickness and alertness. A coloxus prefers to wear opulent clothing and jewels that would rival the wealthiest nobility of any race. A coloxus is 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Ironically—given their grotesque, insectile appearance—coloxus demons are demons of vanity. They are formed from the souls of narcissistic mortals responsible for disasters or tragedy through their careless self-absorption." Chlodo explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the coloxus?" Sumantes asked.

Chlodo returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Despite their foul appearance, coloxus demons consider themselves cultured and elite. They are unusually patient and well mannered for demons, and as a result are often used as emissaries, diplomats, and negotiators by marilith generals, balors, and even demon lords. Even when facing hated foes, coloxus demons are the epitome of courtesy, but such manners are always a deceitful veneer, masking the creatures' efforts to gain the upper hand."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the coloxus so bad?" Sumantes responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Evil mortal spellcasters are  fond of conjuring coloxus demons for similar roles, but the monsters also work well as assassins. Even in this role, a coloxus is dignified and polite. Only when presented with a reflection of itself does the normally civilized coloxus show its true demonic colors—any creature foolish enough to trick a coloxus into looking at a mirror finds herself the eternal foe of an insulted and scandalized demon."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the coloxus so bad?" Sumantes responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Sumantes saw a scary coloxus in the distance! He readied his sword. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter18"></a> Chapter 18: Dudledding Couth and the Lusca

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Dudledding Couth. The scholar loaded a market stall with wares with a abbot. Two spinsters ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Roolio. Sumantes continued down the path. Two balancemakers gazed at him from an open window.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a wattler. Sumantes approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Sumantes, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Euryllus." Sumantes announced.

Nearby, a tapestrymaker sat by the side of the road. The man quietly reminised about the past, then finally responded.

"Our village of Road will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is down the street to the church and left. You'll see a monastery. It's just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. You'll find Amalvin, the best weapons expert we've got. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 4 small coins. "I want that Euryllus gone as much as anybody."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a userer scuttled out of his way. A link boy scuttled out of his way. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Amalvin looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the ceratioidi, or perhaps even the babau, but that's nothing compared to the lusca we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Luscas are among the most feared predators in the open ocean—their snapping shark heads and writhing tentacles spell the end for many crews. A lusca's presence can first be felt in the air, as its body naturally conducts electricity. Sailors who have encountered the being and survived claim that thunderclouds seem to roll in alongside the creature and strange electrical fires dance in the air before it attacks, lending an eerie aura of foreboding to the oncoming assault. Ravenous and unpredictable, a lusca claims wide swaths of territory in order to maximize the number of ships it can sink and crews it can feast upon; luscas brook no other large predators in their claimed territory, and battle even mighty krakens for control. They are equally territorial with their own kind, and an encounter between two luscas, except to mate, almost always ends with one dead or driven off. While luscas prefer to make quick meals of the sailors onboard a ship, they will eat just about any aquatic creature, and even giant octopuses and whales know to steer clear of a hungry lusca's vicinity."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "The average lusca is 90 feet from tentacle to snout and weighs 3,800 pounds. Legends tell of even larger luscas that can sink Colossal ships."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the lusca?" Sumantes asked.

"That's all I can tell you."

Sumantes saw a cruel lusca in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the disagreeable sight. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter19"></a> Chapter 19: Holchley and the Kaprosuchus

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Holchley. Nearby, a hobbler threw punches. A turner gazed at him from an open window. Sumantes continued down the path. Two miners gazed at him from an open window.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a broderer. The man, eying his dangerous demeanor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Sumantes, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Euryllus." Sumantes announced.

A engineer finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Oxfort will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. You'll find Ernstafford, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. Two locksmiths rushed by quickly, ignoring him. The poacher talked excitedly with what appeared to be a ropemaker with a dog trainer. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Ernstafford looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the cuero, or perhaps even the moon giant, but that's nothing compared to the kaprosuchus we've got."

Ernstafford returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Despite its close resemblance to other types of crocodilians, the kaprosuchus is a terrestrial predator, not an aquatic one. Squat and powerfully built, these creatures hunt for prey in forests. The adults can grow up to 20 feet long and weigh as much as 2,500 pounds."

Sumantes slipped the man 9 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Sumantes.

Sumantes saw a repulsive kaprosuchus in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the shameful sight. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter20"></a> Chapter 20: Wemood and the Toad

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Wemood. The beer seller ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Osuuolduin with a pope. The tailor gazed at him from an open window with a prince. Sumantes continued down the path. Two chapmans slept in an alleyway.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a shepherd. The man, eying his determined look, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Euryllus took over?" Sumantes asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a drywaller finished an apple and tossed the core aside. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Dunle will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Melet is down the street to the barn and right. You'll see a cattle barn. It's down the street to the warehouse and right. You'll see a tavern. It's down the street to the church and left. You'll see a inn. It's just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Melet Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a costermonger gazed at him from an open window. Nearby, a king gazed at him from an open window. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Melet looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the crypt thing, or perhaps even the scarecrow, but that's nothing compared to the toad we've got."

"Toads are harmless, rough-skinned amphibians." Melet explained.

Sumantes slipped the man 5 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

Sumantes saw a terrible toad in the distance! The adventurer readied his sword. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter21"></a> Chapter 21: Cheld and the Wyrmwraith

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Cheld. While the sawyer gazed at him from an open window, a cantor rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Nearby, a midwife bit into an apple. Sumantes continued down the path. Nearby, a thresher finished an apple and tossed the core aside.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a canon. The man, eying his impressive armor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Sumantes, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Euryllus." Sumantes announced.

The cutler sat by the side of the road with a ditcher. The man quietly reminised about the past, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Widgenham will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is past the barn. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Sisyphon Fine Supplies". You'll find Sisyphon, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. The scabbard maker slept in an alleyway with a restaurateur. While the halberdier talked excitedly with what appeared to be a canaller, a watchman sat by the side of the road. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Sumantes cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Sisyphon grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of dimorphodons and boggards flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Wyrmwraiths arise from the souls of powerful dragons who refuse to accept death or have an irrational fear of moving on to an afterlife. No longer concerned with amassing wealth and power, wyrmwraiths instead brood with an unrelenting hatred of all living things. They hate other dragons above all else, seeing the existence of those living creatures as a mockery of their own."

Sumantes slipped the man 7 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Sisyphon returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Wyrmwraiths typically haunt their former lairs or some other location where they can hide from the sunlight. They are drawn toward ancient ruins, forgotten catacombs, and other places associated with death. Litter, detritus and bones lie heaped in areas controlled by a wyrmwraith instead of the coins and gems. In the rare instances when a wyrmwraith is away from its den, the malice of its presence still lingers palpably in the cold air. Still displaying the draconic instinct to protect their homes from would-be thieves, wyrmwraiths will often create and leave behind undead guardians."

Sumantes slipped the man 9 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Sisyphon returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Wyrmwraiths slay those who venture near their lairs, surrounding themselves with their newly created dread wraiths and any other undead they can create or control, carving out small fiefdoms populated by undead servitors. They send their minions to collect anything and anyone with knowledge or power they believe can aid them in their dark endeavors. Captured individuals who please the wyrmwraith can expect to be reborn as powerful undead while those that fail wallow in eternal torment as dread wraiths."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"On rare occasions throughout history, powerful necromancers or dark cults have managed to entice or coerce a wyrmwraith into an alliance. These collaborations are fleeting, as wyrmwraiths still retain a twisted shadow of their draconic pride, seeing all other creatures as beneath them. Unless compelled to work with others, a wyrmwraith turns on its allies once they are no longer useful to it." Sisyphon explained.

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Finding a way to gain a wyrmwraith's attention is difficult because it is no longer interested in wealth or other mundane material possessions. Instead, wyrmwraiths seek knowledge or items to reverse or improve their undead condition. Their own loathing of what they have become is the only thing as strong as their hatred of the living. Yet, despite their predicament, they still fear ultimate death."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"A wyrmwraith blights the land with its very presence, a slowly spreading stain tainting anything it touches. Undead activity inevitably increases in any area a wyrmwraith inhabits. Unless a wyrmwraith is destroyed, its territory often becomes a lifeless wasteland for miles." Sisyphon explained.

Sumantes slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Wyrmwraiths are very dangerous opponents in combat. They prefer to soften up enemies with their breath weapon and spells before closing in for melee. Wyrmwraiths target clerics, paladins, and other spellcasters wielding divine magic, both because they know divine magic possesses the greatest threat to them and because they see it as a chance to strike back against the gods for their accursed state. Wyrmwraiths care little about how many of their undead minions are destroyed in combat. They are merely pawns to the wyrmwraiths, who have the means at their disposal to create more." Sisyphon explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the wyrmwraith so bad?" Sumantes responded.

"Wyrmwraiths appear as skeletal, ghostly versions of their former selves, their features warped by malice. No matter the size they once possessed, wyrmwraiths measure roughly 50 ft. from snout to tail. Unencumbered by flesh, they move with a silent, effortless, and deadly grace. Even wyrmwraiths' minds become changed in undeath. Already long-lived creatures when they were dragons, some wyrmwraiths have spent an even longer time as undead. Brooding and nurturing brutal hatred for the living for so long drives these wyrmwraiths insane, causing them to become reckless—or self-destructive—and to venture out into the night to rain down destruction on a nearby settlement or even an entire kingdom, knowing that they will eventually be hunted down and destroyed." Sisyphon explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the wyrmwraith so bad?" Sumantes responded.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Sisyphon was talking about."

## <a name="chapter22"></a> Chapter 22: Ruill and the Dark Dancer

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Ruill. Nearby, a ship's captain finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Nearby, a lady sat by the side of the road. Sumantes continued down the path. A tanner bit into an apple.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a cowherd. Sumantes approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Sumantes, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Euryllus." Sumantes announced.

While the silkmaid threw punches, a farrier scuttled out of his way. He still looked suspiciousHe finally responded.

"Our village of Ningtone will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Gutxinous is down the street to the warehouse and right. You'll see a church. It's down the street to the church and right. You'll see a monastery. It's down the street to the stables and right. You'll see a barn. It's just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Gutxinous Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a wiredrawer finished an apple and tossed the core aside. A scabbard maker eyed him suspiciously. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Sumantes cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Gutxinous lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The dark dancer."

"Though still clad in the tattered dark clothing worn by other dark folk, dark dancers appear to be the most decorated and festive of these strange humanoids. They are intermediaries between clans and factions, and thus clans can't restrict the actions of dark dancers in their realms. Dark dancers answer only to dark stalkers and dark callers." Gutxinous explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the dark dancer?" Sumantes asked.

"Though fickle and erratic, dark dancers are well liked and usually welcome among clans for as long as they wish to stay. Yet they rarely stay long, instead insinuating themselves into dozens of underground communities over the course of a year. They serve as storytellers, entertainers, and messengers. One of their favorite stories to share is about the relationship between their kind and the owbs." Gutxinous explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the dark dancer so bad?" Sumantes responded.

"Though dark dancers are rare and weak, they are highly appreciated by dark folk society. Dark folk consider it a bad omen when a dark dancer dies. Dark dancers stand just under 4 feet tall and weigh 60 pounds." Gutxinous explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the dark dancer?" Sumantes asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Sumantes.

Sumantes saw a hideous dark dancer in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the ruinous sight. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter23"></a> Chapter 23: Chat Pard's Amermen and the Tengu

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Chat Pard's Amermen. Two hay merchants hawked fine imported goods from Shiss. Two furriers talked excitedly with what appeared to be a woodturner. Sumantes continued down the path. The prostitute talked excitedly with what appeared to be a lapidary with a nailer.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a stonecarver. Sumantes approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Euryllus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Sumantes have come to destroy him!" Sumantes exclaimed.

A oyster raker rushed by quickly, ignoring him. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Eastentre will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Feran is the best in town. His shop is past the tavern. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Feran Fine Supplies". And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 5 small coins. "I want that Euryllus gone as much as anybody."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. The terrazo grinder bit into an apple with a ropemaker. A merchant rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Sumantes cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Feran grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of tigers and thunder behemoths flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Feran returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Tengus are a race of avian humanoids that resemble crows or ravens, and often bear much of the same stigma. Though they frequently choose to live among other races in densely populated cities, their society is tight and closed, and they rarely allow others to see its inner workings. Tengus often band together in small groups to create roosts in vacant warehouses or condemned buildings, and these raucous gathering places are generally assumed to be thieves' guilds by outsiders—an assumption that's correct roughly half the time."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the tengu?" Sumantes asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Like the crows they share physical traits with, tengus are naturally covetous, especially of shiny or colorful items, and prone to bouts of good-natured kleptomania if they don't carefully keep themselves in check. Vain and prideful creatures, they are easily persuaded with flattery."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the tengu?" Sumantes asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Sumantes.

Sumantes saw a horrendous tengu in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the ungodly sight. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Sumantes the lion-heartedour hero pulls a up maroon potion from his pack and drinks it. He is reinvigorated. Sumantes lunged toward the tengu, his sword ready to strike! The slippery tengu evaded Sumantes's hit.

Sumantes says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Feran was talking about."

## <a name="chapter24"></a> Chapter 24: Haventreen and the Lizardfolk

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Haventreen. Nearby, a sculptor slept in an alleyway. While the tallowchandler eyed him suspiciously, a begger ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Turstanesinus. Sumantes continued down the path. The drywaller slept in an alleyway with a camp follower.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a stonecarver. The man, eying his foreboding cloak, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Euryllus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Sumantes have come to destroy him!" Sumantes exclaimed.

While the king gazed at him from an open window, a stainer slept in an alleyway. The man quietly reminised about the past, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Sumantes. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Pagal is past the monastery. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. The broderer scuttled out of his way with a builder. While the linenspinner eyed him suspiciously, a stillroom maid threw punches. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Sumantes cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Pagal lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The lizardfolk."

Pagal returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Lizardfolk are proud and powerful reptilian predators that make their communal homes in scattered villages deep within swamps and marshes. Uninterested in colonization of the dry lands and content with the simple weapons and rituals that have served them well for millennia, lizardfolk are viewed by many other races as backwater savages, but within their isolated communities lizardfolk are actually a vibrant people filled with tradition and an oral history stretching back to before humans walked upright."

Sumantes slipped the man 4 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Pagal returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Most lizardfolk stand 6 to 7 feet tall and weigh 200 to 250 pounds, their powerful muscles covered in scales of gray, green, or brown. Some breeds have short dorsal spikes or brightly colored frills, and all swim well by moving with flicks of their powerful 4-foot-long tails. While completely at home in the water, they breathe air and return to their clustered mound-dwellings to breed and sleep. As their reptilian blood makes them sluggish in the cold, most lizardfolk hunt and work during the day and retreat to their homes at night to curl up with other tribesmen in the shared warmth of large peat fires."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the lizardfolk so bad?" Sumantes responded.

"Though generally neutral, lizardfolks' standoffish demeanor, staunch rejection of civilization's "gifts," and legendary ferocity in battle cause them to be viewed negatively by most humanoids. These traits stem from good reasons, however, as their own slow rate of reproduction is no match for warm-blooded humanoids, and those tribes who don't defend their wetland territories to the last breath quickly find themselves overwhelmed by the mammalian hordes. As for their tendency to consume the bodies of dead friends and enemies alike, the practical lizardfolk are quick to point out that life is hard in the swamp, and nothing should go to waste." Pagal explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the lizardfolk so bad?" Sumantes responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "The lizardfolk presented here dwell in a swampy environment. Lizardfolk tribes can exist in other environments as well, but they lose their swim speed and instead gain a climb speed of 15 feet."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the lizardfolk so bad?" Sumantes responded.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Sumantes saw a mean lizardfolk in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the nasty sight. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Pagal was talking about."

## <a name="chapter25"></a> Chapter 25: Ellymon and the Monkey Swarm

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Ellymon. While the carter threw punches, a architect slowly carried supplies. A horner gazed at him from an open window. Sumantes continued down the path. The wattler bit into an apple with a bishop.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a prince. The man, eying his well-made boots, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Euryllus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Sumantes have come to destroy him!" Sumantes exclaimed.

While the oilmaker slept in an alleyway, a guardsman ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Hunas. The man sat in silence for a whileHe finally responded.

"Our village of Alburch will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Domismeneos is just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. The waferer slept in an alleyway with a ferryman. Nearby, a wiredrawer talked excitedly with what appeared to be a harberdasher. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Sumantes cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Domismeneos lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The monkey swarm."

"Monkeys sometimes travel in huge colonies of hundreds of individuals. In such quantities, these primates can become quite dangerous, capable of overwhelming many foes by their sheer numbers." Domismeneos explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the monkey swarm?" Sumantes asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Unlike most swarms, monkey swarms work well together. A swarm of monkeys does not possess a true hive mind, but it is capable of working in tandem with other swarms to make basic tactical decisions in combat."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the monkey swarm so bad?" Sumantes responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Sumantes saw a abominable monkey swarm in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the fairy sight. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Sumantes lunged toward the monkey swarm, his sword ready to strike! The slippery monkey swarm evaded Sumantes's hit. The monster was stunned by the attack. The exaggerated Sumantes pulls a rose pink potion from his pack and drinks it. He is reinvigorated.

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Domismeneos was talking about."

## <a name="chapter26"></a> Chapter 26: Knigwe and the Retriever

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Knigwe. The cannoneer scuttled out of his way with a chainmaker. While the tailor ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Zaratheus, a waxchandler slowly carried supplies. Sumantes continued down the path. While the gunsmith rushed by quickly, ignoring him, a burglar finished an apple and tossed the core aside.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a brushbinder. The man, eying his unusual weapons, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Sumantes, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Euryllus." Sumantes announced.

Two blacksmiths hawked fine imported goods from Toth East Oak. The man eyed him thoughtfullyHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Sumantes. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Lovet is into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk past the inn. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. Two tinsmiths finished an apple and tossed the core aside. A ragpicker finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Lovet looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Lovet lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The retriever."

Lovet returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Not all constructs are formed from unliving matter like stone, wood, metal, or dead flesh. In the darkest corners of the Great Beyond, certain powerful demon lords have mastered the art of shaping the raw, protoplasmic flesh of the Abyss into hideous monstrosities devoid of life, emotion, and the will to resist control. The monstrous retriever is the best-known of such constructs, a huge spider-like creation capable of unleashing potent energy upon those it has been ordered to seek."

Sumantes slipped the man 8 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Demon lords use retrievers to seek out those who dare abandon their loyalties or flee from servitude. Often, the presence of a retriever in a demon's den is enough in and of itself to ensure the loyalty of the lesser demons. The constructs also excel in tracking down specific objects and returning them to their masters—their intelligence is just enough to allow them to focus on their ordered tasks but not quite enough for them to form ideas of rebellion and longings for freedom." Lovet explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the retriever?" Sumantes asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "A retriever's body is the size of an elephant, and its legspan is nearly 30 feet. It weighs 6,500 pounds."

Sumantes slipped the man 10 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Sumantes.

Sumantes saw a horrendous retriever in the distance! He readied his sword. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter27"></a> Chapter 27: Ondon Roadforneywareethnark and the Giant Stag Beetle

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Ondon Roadforneywareethnark. While the pattenmaker finished an apple and tossed the core aside, a silversmith eyed him suspiciously. A prostitute rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Sumantes continued down the path. A summoner hawked fine imported goods from Newbur.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a alewife. The man, eying his foreboding cloak, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Euryllus has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Sumantes have come to destroy him!" Sumantes exclaimed.

Nearby, a reaper finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Bow will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Kyros is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the stables. Eventually you need to walk past the cattle barn. There's a small door. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 10 small coins. "I want that Euryllus gone as much as anybody."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a bather loaded a market stall with wares. Two gardners hawked fine imported goods from Tunbriss. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Sumantes cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Kyros lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The giant stag beetle."

"Nearly 10 feet long, giant stag beetles become serious dangers when they wander into logging camps due to their appetite for decaying wood. Called stag beetles because of their large, antler-like mandibles, they use these appendages to wrestle competing suitors and quickly put down enemy threats." Kyros explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the giant stag beetle?" Sumantes asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Variant species of these giant beetles exist as well. The two detailed below are the ones most commonly encountered."

Sumantes slipped the man 4 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Kyros returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Bombardier Beetle (CR 2): This giant stag beetle has only 2 Hit Dice and is Medium sized, but can spray acid once per round in a 10-foot cone. Those in the cone must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or take 1d4+2 points of acid damage. The save DC is Constitution-based."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the giant stag beetle?" Sumantes asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Goliath Beetle (CR 8): The immense goliath beetle is a Huge stag beetle with 12 HD and the trample special ability."

Sumantes slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

## <a name="chapter28"></a> Chapter 28: Lead and the Gargoyle

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Lead. A chicken butcher sat by the side of the road. A footpad eyed him suspiciously. Sumantes continued down the path. Nearby, a glasspainter hawked fine imported goods from Southwichlonder Ston Squayneldbrimeston Park.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a privycleaner. Sumantes approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Euryllus took over?" Sumantes asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

The fuller bit into an apple with a roper. He still looked suspiciousHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Sumantes. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Asbaducolandrandir is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the inn and right. You'll see a church. It's down the street to the monastery and right. You'll see a barn. It's past the inn. It's just to the left. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 10 small coins. "I want that Euryllus gone as much as anybody."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. While the troubadour rushed by quickly, ignoring him, a scabbard maker loaded a market stall with wares. Nearby, a shoemaker finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Asbaducolandrandir looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Asbaducolandrandir grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of antelopes and muses flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Asbaducolandrandir returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Gargoyles often appear to be winged stone statues, for they can perch indefinitely without moving, allowing them to surprise their foes. Gargoyles tend toward obsessive-compulsive behaviors that are as varied as their kind is plentiful. Books, stolen trinkets, weapons, and grisly trophies harvested from fallen foes are just a few examples of the types of things a gargoyle might collect to decorate its lair and territory. Gargoyles tend toward a solitary lifestyle, though they sometimes form fearsome groups called "wings" for protection and sport. In certain conditions, a tribe of gargoyles might even ally with other creatures, but even the most stable alliances with a gargoyle tribe can collapse for the smallest of reasons—gargoyles are nothing if not treacherous, petty, and vindictive. Gargoyles have been known to dwell in the heart of the largest of cities, crouching amid the decorations of stone cathedrals and buildings where they hide in plain sight by day and swoop down to feed on vagabonds, beggars, and other unfortunates at night."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"The longer a tribe of gargoyles abides in a region of ruins or buildings, the more its members come to resemble that region's architectural styles. The changes a gargoyle's appearance undergoes are slow and subtle, but over the course of years, it can shift radically." Asbaducolandrandir explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the gargoyle?" Sumantes asked.

Asbaducolandrandir returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "One unusual variant of gargoyle dwells not amid buildings and ruins but under the waves of the sea. These creatures are known as kapoacinths—they have the same basic statistics as normal gargoyles, save that they have the aquatic subtype and their wings grant them a swim speed of 60 feet (but are useless for actual flight). Kapoacinths dwell in shallow, coastal regions where they can shamble up from the surf to prey on those that reside there. They are more likely to form wings, as kapoacinths prefer group living to a solitary lifestyle."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the gargoyle so bad?" Sumantes responded.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Sumantes.

## <a name="chapter29"></a> Chapter 29: Wesdenharey and the Giant Owl

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Wesdenharey. While the bookbinder talked excitedly with what appeared to be a singer, a stainer ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Stalert. Two lighter mans sat by the side of the road. Sumantes continued down the path. Two executioners ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Pard.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a cardinal. Sumantes approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Euryllus took over?" Sumantes asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

The abbot slept in an alleyway with a summoner. The man eyed him thoughtfully, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Sumantes. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Fraudin is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. Two shipwrights gazed at him from an open window. A tanner rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Sumantes cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Fraudin grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of plesiosauruss and iron cobras flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "The noble giant owl roosts in the tallest trees or in high caves near its forest home. No mere animals, giant owls pride themselves as intellectuals and keen judges of character. Little passes a giant owl's notice in its home forest. What it doesn't observe directly, it learns from its wide network of animal informants. Giant owls view themselves more as watchers than participants, rarely interfering in the affairs of others barring a threat to their homes. Giant owls stand 18 feet tall and have 30-foot wingspans, yet they rarely weigh over 600 pounds."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the giant owl?" Sumantes asked.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Sumantes saw a menacing giant owl in the distance! Sumantes readied his sword. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter30"></a> Chapter 30: Southnaul and the Juggernaut

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Southnaul. While the organist finished an apple and tossed the core aside, a chandler stood by a market stall, negotiating with the engraver. Nearby, a nobleman threw punches. Sumantes continued down the path. The peasant ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Inge with a midwife.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a librarian. The man, eying his unusual weapons, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Euryllus took over?" Sumantes asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

The joiner eyed him suspiciously with a thonger. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Runburtinswichledoss will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is into the market and towards the tavern. Eventually you need to walk past the stables. It's just to the right. You'll find Recces, the best weapons expert we've got. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 7 small coins. "I want that Euryllus gone as much as anybody."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. The shipwright eyed him suspiciously with a bailiff. Nearby, a chantry priest sat by the side of the road. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Sumantes cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Recces lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The juggernaut."

Recces returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Juggernauts protect locations dedicated to a particular faith, their massive forms infused with divine energy that animates them and infuses them with their deity's power. Some faiths use a juggernaut as a mobile shrine, anointing it with sacred materials and offering prayers to the divine."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the juggernaut so bad?" Sumantes responded.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Sumantes saw a awful juggernaut in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the appalling sight. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter31"></a> Chapter 31: Ere and the Half-celestial Unicorn

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Ere. Two nakerers finished an apple and tossed the core aside. While the jester bit into an apple, a joiner hawked fine imported goods from Slown. Sumantes continued down the path. A weirkeeper eyed him suspiciously.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a shoemaker. The man, eying his determined look, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Sumantes, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Euryllus." Sumantes announced.

The copyist loaded a market stall with wares with a groom. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Sumantes. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Pylewynes is the best in town. His shop is past the monastery. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Pylewynes Fine Supplies". Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a carter stood by a market stall, negotiating with the pioneer. Nearby, a skinner slept in an alleyway. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Pylewynes looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Pylewynes lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The half-celestial unicorn."

"Most half-celestials are born of a mortal who loved a good outsider, but powerful holy magic can also create one." Pylewynes explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the half-celestial unicorn?" Sumantes asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Sumantes.

Sumantes saw a loathsome half-celestial unicorn in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the lousy sight. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter32"></a> Chapter 32: Slowester and the Slime Mold

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Slowester. Two basketmakers slept in an alleyway. Two farriers threw punches. Sumantes continued down the path. Two lawyers sat by the side of the road.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a doctor. Sumantes approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Euryllus took over?" Sumantes asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

The lawyer sat by the side of the road with a blacksmith. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"Our village of Shinchlos will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is into the market and towards the tavern. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. You'll find Gilopos, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a molecatcher slowly carried supplies. Two bowyers sat by the side of the road. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Gilopos looked up from his work behind a counter at Sumantes.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Gilopos lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The slime mold."

Gilopos returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Slime molds are revolting oozes that wallow in rot and decay. A perfect example of symbiosis, each slime mold is covered in a thick garden of fungi, mildew, and toadstools, which helps it blend in with the surroundings. As ambush hunters, they can lie silently in wait for days at a time, surging into frenzied movement as soon as prey comes within reach. Most commonly encountered in deep forests, variations have adapted to life in caverns and sewers as well. They lack any ability to digest food, and rely entirely on their symbiotic fungal gardens to break down any organic matter they find into easily absorbed compost and decay. The molds and mushrooms that coat the ooze in turn receive ample food supplies, and over countless generations, many have developed into deadly variations of the forest or cave fungi from which they evolved. This fungal breakdown is in many ways akin to a disease—known as fungal rot, it can kill if allowed to progress for long. Those who succumb to fungal rot become tired and listless. Eventually, paralysis sets in and the victim's flesh begins to blacken and decay, running from the body in liquid streams that the slime mold can easily absorb. In a somewhat nauseating turnabout, certain creatures find the unusual fungus that grows upon a slime mold to be quite tasty, and these creatures actively hunt slime molds to devour their gardens—although they take care to avoid actual contact with the mold itself unless they happen to be immune to disease."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the slime mold?" Sumantes asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Slime molds are ovoid in shape, growing up to 12 feet in length and weighing more than 600 pounds. Their substance is normally a sickly greenish-brown, with the coloration varying depending on their environment and how recently they've fed. They instinctually keep their coating of fungus and other vegetable detritus exposed above them, granting the slime mold a distinctive, undulating gait rather than the fluid movement of most oozes."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "To reproduce, slime molds split off small patches of their bodies whenever they encounter thick beds of fungi or mold. Over several months, these tiny blobs acclimate to the rot and absorb each another, until a single slime mold (with the young creature simple template) sprouts its own garden and begins hunting live prey."

Sumantes looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Sumantes.

Sumantes saw a obnoxious slime mold in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the loathsome sight. Sumantes hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter33"></a> Chapter 33: Easgot and the Ash Giant

Sumantes followed a dirt path into the village of Easgot. Two wattlers sat by the side of the road. Nearby, a fiddler stood by a market stall, negotiating with the scabbard maker. Sumantes continued down the path. Two broderers stood by a market stall, negotiating with the cartwright.

Eventually, Sumantes arrived at the town square, where he found a mirrorer. Sumantes approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Sumantes, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Euryllus." Sumantes announced.

While the bowman ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Frand, a woodturner sat by the side of the road. He still looked suspicious, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Sumantes. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Gotzstaz is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the warehouse. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the cattle barn and left. You'll see a tavern. It's into the market and towards the tavern. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Sumantes hurried towards the armory. The fletcher stood by a market stall, negotiating with the pavior with a exchequer. The falconer rushed by quickly, ignoring him with a paperer. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Sumantes cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Sumantes, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Euryllus. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the half-celestial unicorn, or perhaps even the vescavor queen, but that's nothing compared to the ash giant we've got."

Gotzstaz returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Whether because of disruptive magic, unearthed deep elements, or alien technology that fell calamitously from the sky, ash giants are victims of their barren terrains. Yet they somehow survive and even thrive in these desperate lands. Ash giants have an uncanny ability to bond with the enormous and often mutated vermin they share the landscape with, and sometimes use the largest of these creatures as mounts."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the ash giant so bad?" Sumantes responded.

"Ash giants are brash and violent, and their humor is incredibly dark. Killing someone through a prank is just as funny as tripping a friend while on a hunt. While not inherently evil, lifetimes of being antagonized by other tribes have practically bred violence into their minds." Gotzstaz explained.

Sumantes slipped the man 10 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Ash giants are 10 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds." Gotzstaz explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the ash giant?" Sumantes asked.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.
