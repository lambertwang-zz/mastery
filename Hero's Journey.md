## <a name="chapter1"></a> Chapter 1: Widen and the Ogre Mage

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Widen. The philosopher hawked fine imported goods from Blow Centon with a chaplain. The tallowchandler talked excitedly with what appeared to be a rat catcher with a bronzefounder. Maixenor continued down the path. The bailiff scuttled out of his way with a fuller.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a rat catcher. Maixenor approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Kebad has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Maixenor have come to destroy him!" Maixenor exclaimed.

Two nailers slowly carried supplies. He still looked suspiciousHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Georgisebe is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the monastery and left. You'll see a church. It's past the church. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Georgisebe Fine Supplies". I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. The dog trainer scuttled out of his way with a exchequer. Nearby, a thonger slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Georgisebe looked up from his work behind a counter at Maixenor.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Georgisebe grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of scarecrows and bakus flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"The ogre mage, like all oni, is an evil spirit come to the Material Plane and clad in living flesh—in this case, that of a brutish ogre. Ogre mages are often found serving as leaders of ogre tribes, yet not all of them seek to link their destinies to their less-intelligent kin. Some become lone marauders who hold villages hostage, demanding regular tribute in the form of gold, food, or maidens, lest they take more than they ask." Georgisebe explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the ogre mage so bad?" Maixenor responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Georgisebe called out

"Wait, you'll need a weapon worthy of your great cause. That rusty sword won't do." 

"Take this dwarven war-shield. It has served a well over a dozen adventureres before you and it should serve you well too."

Sheathing his dwarven war-shield, Maixenor leaves Widen on a journey to find the ogre mage. 

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Widen, he turned to his right and saw something fearless.

The Headlands of Mook towered over the nearby River islands.Maybe they might make for a mythological adventure for when Maixenor's current journey is over.

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

He met a wandering reeve making his way toward Widen. The stranger said to Maixenor

"The ogre mage killed my brother. I would be heading back to end that horrendous thing if only it hadn't taken my eye the first time I tried."

The ever grandiose Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the ogre mage.

Not once did Maixenor regret his choice to not become a singer.

The ever grand Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the ogre mage.

Not once did he regret his choice to not become a waterman.

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Widen, he turned to his right and saw something undaunted.

The Mountain passes of Cankmanalephey towered over the nearby Kames.Maybe they might make for a lion-hearted adventure for when Maixenor's current journey is over.

Maixenor saw a shameful ogre mage in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the beastly sight. Maixenor hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Maixenor cleared his mind, preparing himself for the combat to come.The ogre mage struck with its greatsword! The fierce blow from the monster narrowly misses the gritty Maixenor. 

A bold attack suddenly came from Maixenor, its intent to silence the mean beast once and for all. The revolting ogre mage was too quick to be hit. Struck by the hefty blow, the ogre mage needed a second to recover its footing. Maixenor the high-flown made a mighty swing at the ogre mage with this dwarven war-shield. Maixenor's strike glanced off of the ogre mage's hide. 

The dwarven war-shield of Maixenor was raised high only to be brought down onto the ogre mage moments later. A sharp crack was heard as the strike left its mark. Struck by the hefty blow, the ogre mage needed a second to recover its footing. He sneaked around to ogre mage's blind spot. 

A valorous attack suddenly came from Maixenor, its intent to silence the unkind beast once and for all. The attack from he surely left a impression. Struck by the hefty blow, the ogre mage needed a second to recover its footing. Maixenor lunged toward the ogre mage, his dwarven war-shield ready to strike! The shattering blow from he rumbled through the ground. 

A valiant attack suddenly came from Maixenor, its intent to silence the disgusting beast once and for all. That blow seemed like it could break some bones. The ogre mage struck with its greatsword! He jumps out of the way. Maixenor took a deep breath and swung toward the ungodly ogre mage. The attack from he surely left a impression. 

The ogre mage struck with its greatsword! Maixenor jumps out of the way. Maixenor lunged toward the ogre mage, his dwarven war-shield ready to strike! The attack from the daring Maixenor surely left a impression. 

A fearless attack suddenly came from Maixenor, its intent to silence the sickie beast once and for all. A sharp crack was heard as the strike left its mark. A powerful swing came from the ogre mage with very deadly intent. The grim ogre mage failed to land its hit. Maixenor took a deep breath and swung toward the loathsome ogre mage. The ogre mage was struck by the blow! 

Maixenor cleared his mind, preparing himself for the combat to come.The ogre mage eyed Maixenor with a dangerous glare. 

The heinous monster took a swipe at Maixenor. The fierce blow from the monster narrowly misses he. Maixenor lunged toward the ogre mage, his dwarven war-shield ready to strike! The slippery ogre mage evaded Maixenor's hit. 

Maixenor lunged toward the ogre mage, his dwarven war-shield ready to strike! The ogre mage was struck by the blow! The monster was stunned by the attack. A unafraid attack suddenly came from Maixenor, its intent to silence the abominable beast once and for all. The attack from Maixenor surely left a impression. 

The ogre mage eyed Maixenor with a dangerous glare. The heinous monster took a swipe at Maixenor. He winces from the pain but continues fighting. 

Maixenor cleared his mind, preparing himself for the combat to come.The ogre mage struck with its greatsword! Maixenor reeled back in pain. 

A tall standing attack suddenly came from Maixenor, its intent to silence the evil beast once and for all. That blow seemed like it could break some bones. 

Maixenor's last strike hit the ogre mage directly in the heary. A fatal blow.

Maixenor says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Georgisebe was talking about."

## <a name="chapter2"></a> Chapter 2: Ell DÃ»m and the Mihstu

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Ell DÃ»m. Nearby, a lawyer hawked fine imported goods from Tyne. Nearby, a quartermaster ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Challitus. Maixenor continued down the path. The master of hounds bit into an apple with a fabricshearer.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a harness maker. The man, eying his impressive armor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Maixenor, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Kebad." Maixenor announced.

The dairymaid sat by the side of the road with a wood seller. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Cilius is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. The lapidary threw punches with a spurrer. A fool for money bit into an apple. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Maixenor cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the hippopotamus, or perhaps even the dragonkin, but that's nothing compared to the mihstu we've got."

Cilius returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The deadly mihstus hail from the Plane of Air. When they come to the Material Plane, they prefer to inhabit dank dungeon corridors, abandoned ruins, and the forgotten corridors of lost civilizations. Scholars dispute what drives the ambitions of these creatures, or even what they seek on the Material Plane, but all agree that they are deadly combatants and merciless hunters. Their semi-solid bodies appear to be composed of a strange, white smoke, and they can shape their vaporous bodies at will to seep through small cracks and openings in pursuit of prey. When attacking, they coalesce the tips of their misty tentacles into wickedly barbed talons, slashing at opponents with these razor-sharp appendages. Mihstus rely on their insubstantial nature to close with opponents quickly, engulfing the nearest threat while continuing to attack any who seek to deprive them of their chosen victim. When a mihstu manages to embrace a foe with its body, it drains away the creature's vital fluids at an alarming rate. These fluids churn in the creature's body for a few rounds before spattering against nearby walls or on the floor—the mihstu seems to gain no nourishment from these fluids, so this attack may be nothing more than a favorite method of cruelty."

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Cilius returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Mihstus are immortal unless slain by violence, and if properly bargained with, these deadly outsiders can actually be intriguing sources of information. Mihstus are normally interested in little more than stalking and consuming prey, and as a result only tend to provide reliable information or cooperate when supplied with intriguing victims to pursue and destroy. Nefarious creatures such as rakshasas and evil cloud giants often utilize mihstus as trackers and assassins, or sometimes employ them as guards in the forgotten corridors of their lairs."

Maixenor slipped the man 2 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Cilius called out

"Before you go, get rid of that useless sword. It won't make a dent against the carapace of the mihstu." 

"Take this shotel. It has served a well over a dozen adventureres before you and it should serve you well too."

With his newfound information, Maixenor departs from Ell DÃ»m. 

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

He met a wandering lady making his way toward Ell DÃ»m. The stranger said to Maixenor

"Take care crossing the Key Hoodoos! They are especially dangerous this time of year."

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Ell DÃ»m, he turned to his left and saw something noble.

The classic Maixenor could barely make out some Vales in the distance.Maybe they might make for a gallant adventure for when Maixenor's current journey is over.

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Ell DÃ»m, he turned to his left and saw something intrepid.

The Straths of Richley towered over the nearby Mountain passes.Maybe they might make for a valiant adventure for when Maixenor's current journey is over.

The ever elevated Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the mihstu.

Not once did the adventurer regret his choice to not become a hawker.

## <a name="chapter3"></a> Chapter 3: Bark and the Giant Ant

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Bark. Two tumblers rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Nearby, a basketmaker loaded a market stall with wares. Maixenor continued down the path. Nearby, a bleacher hawked fine imported goods from Ere.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a beer seller. Maixenor approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Kebad has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Maixenor have come to destroy him!" Maixenor exclaimed.

A executioner gazed at him from an open window. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Euthremismas is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the church. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Euthremismas Fine Supplies". Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a oil merchant scuttled out of his way. The famulus sat by the side of the road with a pastrycook. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Euthremismas looked up from his work behind a counter at Maixenor.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Euthremismas lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The giant ant."

"Giant ants are as industrious as their normal-sized kin. While their nests generally don't consist of thousands, their greatly increased size more than compensates." Euthremismas explained.

Maixenor slipped the man 4 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Euthremismas returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The statistics given above are for soldier ants—the variety most commonly encountered. The following simple templates can be used to create variants of the standard soldier ant."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the giant ant so bad?" Maixenor responded.

"Worker (–1 CR) Worker ants do not have a poison sting attack or a grab special attack." Euthremismas explained.

Maixenor slipped the man 9 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Drone (+1 CR) Drones have the advanced simple template and a fly speed of 30 feet (average)." Euthremismas explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the giant ant so bad?" Maixenor responded.

"Queen (+2 CR) The queen of a nest is an immense, bloated creature. She gains the advanced and the giant simple templates, but drops her speed to 10 feet and loses her climb speed entirely." Euthremismas explained.

Maixenor slipped the man 2 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Maixenor.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Euthremismas called out

"Wait, you'll need a weapon worthy of your great cause. That rusty sword won't do." 

"Take this flying blade. It has served a well over a dozen adventureres before you and it should serve you well too."

Sheathing his flying blade, Maixenor leaves Bark on a journey to find the giant ant. 

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Bark, he turned to his left and saw something exaggerated.

Contrasting against the nearby Proglacial lakes, the great Vaul Seamounts provided a refreshing view.Maybe they might make for a unafraid adventure for when Maixenor's current journey is over.

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Bark, he turned to his left and saw something noble.

Some distant Geos stood out against the horizon.It reminded Maixenor the noble of the town of Pel 5 he had visited long ago.

The ever valorous Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the giant ant.

Not once did he regret his choice to not become a hayward.

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Bark, he turned to his left and saw something valiant.

The Pseudocraters of Wal Straner towered over the nearby Diatremes.Maybe they might make for a grand adventure for when Maixenor's current journey is over.

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

He met a wandering beerbrewer making his way toward Bark. The stranger said to Maixenor

"Take care crossing the Hill Channels! They are especially dangerous this time of year."

Maixenor saw a unholy giant ant in the distance! He readied his sword. Maixenor hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Maixenor lunged toward the giant ant, his flying blade ready to strike! That blow seemed like it could break some bones. Struck by the hefty blow, the giant ant needed a second to recover its footing. A valiant attack suddenly came from Maixenor, its intent to silence the shocking beast once and for all. The giant ant was struck by the blow! 

The fearful monster took a swipe at Maixenor. The terrible giant ant failed to land its hit. Maixenor took a deep breath and swung toward the cruel giant ant. That blow seemed like it could break some bones. 

Maixenor sneaked around to giant ant's blind spot. The giant ant eyed Maixenor with a dangerous glare. 

The adventurer made a mighty swing at the giant ant with this flying blade. That blow seemed like it could break some bones. A powerful swing came from the giant ant with very deadly intent.

A undaunted attack suddenly came from Maixenor, its intent to silence the revolting beast once and for all. Although our hero's hit landed, giant ant is mostly unphased

Maixenor's last strike hit the giant ant directly in the heary. A fatal blow.

Maixenor says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Euthremismas was talking about."

## <a name="chapter4"></a> Chapter 4: Newton Grew Whetond and the Nulmind

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Newton Grew Whetond. While the chapman ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Andros, a lady slowly carried supplies. While the chaplain slept in an alleyway, a trapper threw punches. Maixenor continued down the path. The sea captain rushed by quickly, ignoring him with a cannoneer.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a embroiderer. The man, eying his foreboding cloak, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Kebad has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Maixenor have come to destroy him!" Maixenor exclaimed.

A belter sat by the side of the road. The man eyed him thoughtfully, then finally responded.

"Our village of Newton Grew Whetond will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Deenes is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Deenes Fine Supplies". Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. While the lady slept in an alleyway, a sea captain finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The glazier stood by a market stall, negotiating with the lensgrinder with a chicken butcher. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Maixenor cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the howler, or perhaps even the putrid ooze, but that's nothing compared to the nulmind we've got."

Deenes returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The tremendously dangerous nulmind is a fungal creature believed by many sages to have extraterrestrial origins. It is drawn to areas of innate magical power or populated by spellcasters, feasting off the magic in the area while slowly wearing down the inhabitants' mental faculties with mind-numbing thoughts and images. Users of psychic magic prove to be favored targets, as their mental energy is especially empowering to the fungi. A creature that succumbs to a nulmind's mind drain aura might eventually become enslaved to the fungus's alien will, the nulmind using such unfortunate creatures to draw in further prey. A creature enslaved in this way is incapable of seeing to even its own basic needs, becoming a simple extension of the nulmind's need to feed."

Maixenor slipped the man 7 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Left unchecked, a nulmind rapidly depletes the local wildlife, as its mindless servants starve to death. Animal life provides very little sustenance for the creature, and a nulmind inevitably works to find richer sources of intelligence and spell power to devour. This sometimes leads the fungus to communities on the border of its forest or to gravitate toward woodland-bound druidic circles. Because of this, druid enclaves often actively hunt and destroy these creatures before they can wreak havoc on the local ecosystem. Despite the fungi's plantlike nature, most druidic communities view nulminds as anathema to the natural order." Deenes explained.

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Deenes returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Nulminds are fortunately rare, with no documented culture or organization. These creatures rarely work well in concert, as each is ultimately selfish and sees only to its own needs, draining even its fellows without hesitation. Despite their insatiability, nulminds seem to lack a taste for the mental energy of fey creatures. While the fungi still defend themselves against fey creatures, they go out of their way to avoid areas where such creatures live."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the nulmind so bad?" Maixenor responded.

"A nulmind moves by compressing and shifting its body, creeping slowly like a caterpillar. A nulmind is about 3 feet long and weighs 50 pounds." Deenes explained.

Maixenor slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"That's all I can tell you."

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Deenes called out

"Before you go, get rid of that useless sword. It won't make a dent against the carapace of the nulmind." 

"Take this totem spear. It has served a well over a dozen adventureres before you and it should serve you well too."

## <a name="chapter5"></a> Chapter 5: Gil and the Bat

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Gil. While the pavior talked excitedly with what appeared to be a beerbrewer, a shingler sat by the side of the road. Nearby, a curate talked excitedly with what appeared to be a wheelwright. Maixenor continued down the path. Nearby, a oilmaker loaded a market stall with wares.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a parchmenter. The man, eying his well-made boots, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Kebad has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Maixenor have come to destroy him!" Maixenor exclaimed.

The saddler loaded a market stall with wares with a butler. The man eyed him thoughtfullyHe finally responded.

"Our village of Gil will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Euryleodberthus is down the street to the monastery and right. You'll see a cattle barn. It's just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. The salter eyed him suspiciously with a beguine. While the famulus loaded a market stall with wares, a shipchandler threw punches. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Maixenor cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Euryleodberthus grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of adamantine golems and contemplatives flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Euryleodberthus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Most bats are insectivores or fruit-eaters, but at least one species drinks blood."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the bat?" Maixenor asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Maixenor.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Euryleodberthus called out

"Wait, you'll need a weapon worthy of your great cause. That rusty sword won't do." 

"Take this cutlass. It has served a well over a dozen adventureres before you and it should serve you well too."

Sheathing his cutlass, Maixenor leaves Gil on a journey to find the bat. 

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Gil, he turned to his right and saw something stouthearted.

Some distant Summits stood out against the horizon.It reminded he of the town of Tufne he had visited long ago.

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Gil, he turned to his left and saw something gutsy.

The Volcanic plateaus of Harwis towered over the nearby Lava plains.Maybe they might make for a fire-eating adventure for when Maixenor's current journey is over.

## <a name="chapter6"></a> Chapter 6: Grave and the Great White Whale

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Grave. The canaller stood by a market stall, negotiating with the scholar with a tapestrymaker. A carpenter rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Maixenor continued down the path. A bellmaker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a founder.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a buttonmaker. The man, eying his determined look, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Maixenor, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Kebad." Maixenor announced.

A herald rushed by quickly, ignoring him. The man quietly reminised about the past, then finally responded.

"Our village of Grave will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Gaut is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the barn and left. You'll see a cattle barn. It's just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 4 small coins. "I want that Kebad gone as much as anybody."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. A bather ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Lovechthaon. Two butlers finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Maixenor cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Gaut grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of ratlings and spider swarms flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Gaut returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Legendary in size and temper, great white whales are far more aggressive than their smaller kin."

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Maixenor.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Gaut called out

"Before you go, get rid of that useless sword. It won't make a dent against the carapace of the great white whale." 

"Forged by the finest dwarven smiths in the mountains of Leigh, this dwarven maulaxe is the finest display of craftsmanship for miles around."

Sheathing his dwarven maulaxe, Maixenor leaves Grave on a journey to find the great white whale. 

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

## <a name="chapter7"></a> Chapter 7: Ruisley and the Bunyip

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Ruisley. While the butler finished an apple and tossed the core aside, a tinker slept in an alleyway. Two theologians talked excitedly with what appeared to be a mailmaker. Maixenor continued down the path. A pavior slept in an alleyway.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a brewer. The man, eying his foreboding cloak, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Kebad took over?" Maixenor asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

While the carver rushed by quickly, ignoring him, a currier hawked fine imported goods from Rod Bre. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Arnouthyrsos is the best in town. His shop is past the stables. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Arnouthyrsos Fine Supplies". I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. Two braziers scuttled out of his way. The carver gazed at him from an open window with a sailmaker. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Arnouthyrsos looked up from his work behind a counter at Maixenor.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Arnouthyrsos lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The bunyip."

The armorer sighed and continued. "The bunyip is a fierce and avid hunter, possessing a primal ruthlessness that seems almost evil in its rapacity. A bunyip typically inhabits large freshwater inlets or sheltered coastal sea caves where food is plentiful—the bunyip is equally at home in fresh or salt water. It prefers feeding on animals of Small size or larger, though it isn't averse to eating humanoids when presented the opportunity. Bunyips are quite territorial, and readily attack when intruders threaten their hunting grounds. Bunyips mate annually, during the late spring. During this period, bunyips become even more aggressive. After mating, couples split, with the female wandering off to find a place to birth a small litter of four to six pups. Females watch their pups for a few days, until they become independent enough for the mothers to move on."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the bunyip so bad?" Maixenor responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Reports of bunyip sightings come from every end of the map. Though the accuracy of all such reports remains doubtful, enough reliable accounts exist to confirm their widespread adaptability. The species thrives in numerous ecological climes, from frigid polar fjords to idyllic tropical lagoons. The bunyip is not a deep-sea creature, and even avoids larger freshwater lakes, as it prefers to lurk near shorelines where its favorite food is more common."

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"While bunyips vary in appearance, all possess similar basic physical structures. The bunyip's head exhibits strong seal-like features, save for its shark-like jaws. Its upper torso is thick and muscular, with long, fin-like limbs. Some species even have a single, shark-like dorsal fin. The remaining portion of the body extends into a long tail. Those with fur usually only grow a short coat on the upper body in shades of pale gray, brown, or black. " Arnouthyrsos explained.

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"That's all I can tell you."

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Arnouthyrsos called out

"Before you go, get rid of that useless sword. It won't make a dent against the carapace of the bunyip." 

"Forged by the finest dwarven smiths in the mountains of Strairch, this flying blade is the finest display of craftsmanship for miles around."

Sheathing his flying blade, Maixenor leaves Ruisley on a journey to find the bunyip. 

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Ruisley, he turned to his left and saw something gutsy.

Some distant Oceanic trenchs stood out against the horizon.Maybe they might make for a stouthearted adventure for when Maixenor's current journey is over.

"You must be on your way to kill the bunyip. I wish you the best of luck!"

The ever fire-eating Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the bunyip.

Not once did our hero regret his choice to not become a scabbard maker.

## <a name="chapter8"></a> Chapter 8: Poodfiell and the Adult Copper Dragon

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Poodfiell. The cartwright stood by a market stall, negotiating with the outlaw with a horner. Two plumbers hawked fine imported goods from Upne. Maixenor continued down the path. A parish priest stood by a market stall, negotiating with the wiredrawer.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a quarryman. The man, eying his dangerous demeanor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Kebad took over?" Maixenor asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a master of hounds rushed by quickly, ignoring him. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Anfred is the best in town. His shop is past the tavern. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Anfred Fine Supplies". I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. While the nailmaker threw punches, a wine seller eyed him suspiciously. The papermaker finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a coppersmith, redsmith. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Anfred looked up from his work behind a counter at Maixenor.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Anfred grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of ghorazaghs and giant tarantulas flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Anfred returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The monster adult copper dragon is terrifying for sure, but I honestly don't know much about that beast."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the adult copper dragon?" Maixenor asked.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Anfred called out

"Wait, you'll need a weapon worthy of your great cause. That rusty sword won't do." 

"Take this heavy pick. It has served a well over a dozen adventureres before you and it should serve you well too."

With his newfound information, Maixenor departs from Poodfiell. 

The ever valiant Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the adult copper dragon.

Not once did he regret his choice to not become a bodger.

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

He met a wandering pattenmaker making his way toward Poodfiell. The stranger said to Maixenor

"Take care crossing the Boston-supon Dolines! They are especially dangerous this time of year."

Maixenor met a wandering burglar making his way toward Poodfiell. The stranger said to Maixenor

"The adult copper dragon killed my brother. I would be heading back to end that awful thing if only it hadn't taken my eye the first time I tried."

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Poodfiell, he turned to his left and saw something undaunted.

The Hogbacks of Horthwickholvesterbromptond Hiling towered over the nearby Continental shelfs.Maybe they might make for a classic adventure for when Maixenor's current journey is over.

## <a name="chapter9"></a> Chapter 9: Kninals Hast Herstoch and the Barometz

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Kninals Hast Herstoch. The costermonger threw punches with a parchmenter. The bonecarver scuttled out of his way with a pardoner. Maixenor continued down the path. While the cantor loaded a market stall with wares, a cantor talked excitedly with what appeared to be a privycleaner.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a shipwright. The man, eying his unusual weapons, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Kebad took over?" Maixenor asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Two dentists stood by a market stall, negotiating with the brazier. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Axylus is past the warehouse. It's just to the right. Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. A bellfounder gazed at him from an open window. Two players scuttled out of his way. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Maixenor cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Axylus grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of beheadeds and gray renders flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Axylus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "These massive plant juggernauts were not created by nature, but grown by druids who use them as protectors and dispensers of savage judgment. Pruned into a form resembling a stout ram, a barometz is granted a degree of intelligence by natural spirits bound into its verdant bulk."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the barometz so bad?" Maixenor responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Barometzes are typically found in the service of the powerful druids who cultivate them and help them protect sacred primeval forests."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the barometz?" Maixenor asked.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Axylus called out

"Wait, you'll need a weapon worthy of your great cause. That rusty sword won't do." 

"Forged by the finest dwarven smiths in the mountains of NoringhtsterlthannÃºminsburn Keichwayne, this light spiked shield is the finest display of craftsmanship for miles around."

## <a name="chapter10"></a> Chapter 10: Crawk Rohapher and the Iron Golem

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Crawk Rohapher. While the belter talked excitedly with what appeared to be a buttonmaker, a spearman slept in an alleyway. Two wiredrawers eyed him suspiciously. Maixenor continued down the path. A bleacher hawked fine imported goods from Walham.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a bearleader. Maixenor approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Kebad took over?" Maixenor asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

A bailiff bit into an apple. The man quietly reminised about the pastHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is past the barn. It's just to the left. You'll find Ihazilokrus, the best weapons expert we've got. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. Two sawyers talked excitedly with what appeared to be a pikeman. Two cardinals ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Donos. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Maixenor cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the phycomid, or perhaps even the storm hag, but that's nothing compared to the iron golem we've got."

"An iron golem has a humanoid body made from iron. It can be sculpted into any shape its creator desires, but it almost always displays armor of some sort, from simple and utilitarian to ceremonial and ornate. Its features are much smoother than those of a stone golem. Iron golems sometimes carry a weapon in one hand, though they rarely use these, relying instead on their slam attacks. " Ihazilokrus explained.

Maixenor slipped the man 5 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Ihazilokrus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "An iron golem is 12 feet tall and weighs about 5,000 pounds. An iron golem cannot speak or make any vocal noise, nor does it have any distinguishable odor."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the iron golem so bad?" Maixenor responded.

"Although the practice has fallen out of favor in modern times, the ancients of certain powerful civilizations once took great pride in crafting iron golems of tremendous size and strength. These golems, which are never smaller than Huge, still exist in remote parts of the world, mindlessly following the orders of a long-dead empire." Ihazilokrus explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the iron golem?" Maixenor asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Maixenor.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Ihazilokrus called out

"Before you go, get rid of that useless sword. It won't make a dent against the carapace of the iron golem." 

"Forged by the finest dwarven smiths in the mountains of Ashfierington, this gnome hooked hammer is the finest display of craftsmanship for miles around."

With his newfound information, Maixenor departs from Crawk Rohapher. 

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

He met a wandering troubadour making his way toward Crawk Rohapher. The stranger said to Maixenor

"The iron golem killed my brother. I would be heading back to end that offensive thing if only it hadn't taken my eye the first time I tried."

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

## <a name="chapter11"></a> Chapter 11: Claphefiel Gresbury Lanslesten and the Dragon Horse

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Claphefiel Gresbury Lanslesten. While the silversmith bit into an apple, a raker ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Xarleu. While the founder stood by a market stall, negotiating with the threadmaker, a dwarf stood by a market stall, negotiating with the watchman. Maixenor continued down the path. Nearby, a glasspainter threw punches.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a sheepshearer. Maixenor approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Kebad took over?" Maixenor asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

While the drycooper loaded a market stall with wares, a archbishop finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The man quietly reminised about the past, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Loxias is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 9 small coins. "I want that Kebad gone as much as anybody."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. A ropemaker sat by the side of the road. The prostitute eyed him suspiciously with a watchman. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Maixenor cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the triton, or perhaps even the globster, but that's nothing compared to the dragon horse we've got."

Loxias returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Despite their name, dragon horses are not related to dragons. These noble creatures gain their name from their ability to fly through the air without wings and to create different effects with their misty breath."

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Dragon horses are solitary creatures, spending most of their time up among the clouds and rarely setting hoof to solid ground. A mated pair of dragon horses remains together to raise its young, but otherwise individuals prefer to be on their own. They are fierce and reclusive, but peaceful and even playful under the right circumstances. Dragon horses sometimes offer aid and assistance to decent folk in need, taking care to use their ability to know alignment to avoid accidentally providing aid to evil creatures, whom they despise." Loxias explained.

Maixenor slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Loxias returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Dragon horse foals are highly prized as potential steeds, but as dragon horses are highly intelligent creatures, they cannot be trained as if they were animals. Instead, one who seeks a dragon horse mount must use diplomacy to secure the creature's aid."

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Peaceful creatures by nature, dragon horses prefer to avoid combat by flying away. When they are forced to fight (often in response to an evil creature's mayhem), they attempt to deal nonlethal damage to all but evil-aligned foes, leaving any unconscious opponents unharmed. Those who have chosen evil ways may sometimes receive the same mercy, in the hope that it helps them see the light, but innately evil foes are dispatched as quickly and cleanly as possible." Loxias explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the dragon horse so bad?" Maixenor responded.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Maixenor.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Loxias called out

"Before you go, get rid of that useless sword. It won't make a dent against the carapace of the dragon horse." 

"Take this combat scabbard. It has served a well over a dozen adventureres before you and it should serve you well too."

Sheathing his combat scabbard, Maixenor leaves Claphefiel Gresbury Lanslesten on a journey to find the dragon horse. 

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Claphefiel Gresbury Lanslesten, he turned to his left and saw something inflated.

The Volcanic dams of Olde & Wildbrombe towered over the nearby Shores.It reminded Maixenor the gritty of the town of Maister he had visited long ago.

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

Maixenor met a wandering swineherd making his way toward Claphefiel Gresbury Lanslesten. The stranger said to Maixenor

"Take care crossing the Sloadbrimlister Lava plains! They are especially dangerous this time of year."

The ever courageous Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the dragon horse.

Not once did Maixenor regret his choice to not become a pavyler.

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

He met a wandering clockmaker making his way toward Claphefiel Gresbury Lanslesten. The stranger said to Maixenor

"I knew a valorous hero like you. He met his end far too early. I hope that you are better prepared for your future."

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Claphefiel Gresbury Lanslesten, he turned to his left and saw something fearless.

The Poljes of Clad towered over the nearby Dolines.It reminded he of the town of Colington he had visited long ago.

Maixenor saw a eerie dragon horse in the distance! Maixenor the courageous readied his sword. He approched the dragon horse cautiously, careful not to rush to an untimely death.

"Gerius is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Gerius Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. While the theologian eyed him suspiciously, a horner loaded a market stall with wares. Two pastrycooks gazed at him from an open window. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Maixenor cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Gerius lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The orang-pendak."

"Orang-pendaks are a rare offshoot of the sasquatch species that dwells in remote mountainous jungles. Elusive and shy, they are rarely seen by other races. Given their friendship with apes (gibbons and orangutans in particular) and their hunched posture and shaggy fur—ranging from tawny or reddish to dark brown or black—they are often mistaken for those beasts at a distance. Orang-pendaks train apes and monkeys to hunt and fight for them, but despite the friendship and similar appearance, the species are not closely related." Gerius explained.

Maixenor slipped the man 4 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Within their remote holds, Orang-pendaks cluster together into seminomadic tribes, hunting and gathering in a region until food and game becomes scarce, then moving on to the next area. Many tribes follow a regional pattern to this migration, allowing parts of the jungle to repopulate and gathering only enough substance so as not to disrupt the land's ability to recoup the losses." Gerius explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the orang-pendak so bad?" Maixenor responded.

Gerius returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Orang-pendaks range from 3 to 5 feet tall as adults, weighing up to 150 pounds, and they are quite strong for their size. Orang-pendaks are largely herbivorous, but sometimes hunt with spears, clubs, and bolas."

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Gerius called out

"Wait, you'll need a weapon worthy of your great cause. That rusty sword won't do." 

"Forged by the finest dwarven smiths in the mountains of Ford Ladifax, this falcata is the finest display of craftsmanship for miles around."

With his newfound information, Maixenor departs from Whephals. 

The ever elevated Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the orang-pendak.

Not once did our hero regret his choice to not become a doctor.

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

Our hero met a wandering wood seller making his way toward Whephals. The stranger said to Maixenor

"I knew a unafraid hero like you. He met his end far too early. I hope that you are better prepared for your future."

The ever bigger than life Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the orang-pendak.

Not once did he regret his choice to not become a thonger.

The ever bigger than life Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the orang-pendak.

Not once did Maixenor regret his choice to not become a old-clothes dealer.

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Whephals, he turned to his right and saw something impavid.

The Mid-ocean ridges of Falingdon towered over the nearby AbÃ®mes.Maybe they might make for a noble adventure for when Maixenor's current journey is over.

Maixenor saw a evil orang-pendak in the distance! Maixenor the fearless readied his sword. He approched the orang-pendak cautiously, careful not to rush to an untimely death. 

The awful monster took a swipe at Maixenor. The adventurer blocks the strike with his falcata. A fearless attack suddenly came from Maixenor, its intent to silence the terrible beast once and for all. The slippery orang-pendak evaded Maixenor's hit. 

A gutty attack suddenly came from Maixenor, its intent to silence the horrid beast once and for all. The orang-pendak was struck by the blow! Struck by the hefty blow, the orang-pendak needed a second to recover its footing. Maixenor took a deep breath and swung toward the detestable orang-pendak. The attack from he surely left a impression. 

He pulled a maroon crayola potion from his pack and drinks it. He is reinvigorated. The orang-pendak struck with its spear! He jumps out of the way. 

The orang-pendak eyed Maixenor with a dangerous glare. The horrid monster took a swipe at Maixenor. Maixenor the gritty blocks the strike with his falcata. 

The falcata of Maixenor was raised high only to be brought down onto the orang-pendak moments later. The shattering blow from he rumbled through the ground. 

Maixenor's last strike hit the orang-pendak directly in the heary. A fatal blow.

The citizens of Whephals could sleep soundly at night. The unafraid Maixenor had vanquished their greatest nightmare.

## <a name="chapter13"></a> Chapter 13: Pincark and the Aurochs

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Pincark. Nearby, a bagger ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Arnald. The silkwoman scuttled out of his way with a hayward. Maixenor continued down the path. A glass seller talked excitedly with what appeared to be a grocer.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a hobbler. Maixenor approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Kebad has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Maixenor have come to destroy him!" Maixenor exclaimed.

While the turner loaded a market stall with wares, a camp follower eyed him suspiciously. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Martaulfrax is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the cattle barn and left. You'll see a monastery. It's down the street to the warehouse and right. You'll see a monastery. It's just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. While the bargeman hawked fine imported goods from Midge, a sea captain gazed at him from an open window. Two famuluss rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Martaulfrax looked up from his work behind a counter at Maixenor.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the dire weasel, or perhaps even the giant stag beetle, but that's nothing compared to the aurochs we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Aurochs (both singular and plural) are large herd animals similar to domesticated cattle."

Maixenor slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Martaulfrax called out

"Wait, you'll need a weapon worthy of your great cause. That rusty sword won't do." 

"Take this boarding gaff. It has served a well over a dozen adventureres before you and it should serve you well too."

With his newfound information, Maixenor departs from Pincark. 

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

Maixenor met a wandering ditcher making his way toward Pincark. The stranger said to Maixenor

"The aurochs killed my brother. I would be heading back to end that horrendous thing if only it hadn't taken my eye the first time I tried."

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

## <a name="chapter14"></a> Chapter 14: Hershfos and the Exscinder

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Hershfos. A mapmaker scuttled out of his way. While the wood seller ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Hoiples, a plowman talked excitedly with what appeared to be a nailer. Maixenor continued down the path. A sergeant bit into an apple.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a bronzefounder. Maixenor approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Kebad has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Maixenor have come to destroy him!" Maixenor exclaimed.

Two drummers eyed him suspiciously. The man quietly reminised about the past, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Cudd is down the street to the cattle barn and left. You'll see a church. It's past the barn. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Cudd Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 3 small coins. "I want that Kebad gone as much as anybody."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a engraver hawked fine imported goods from Edirister-Lymon Stralingby. The harness maker hawked fine imported goods from Shephazad with a knight. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Maixenor cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Cudd grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of dwiergeths and heresy devil (ayngavhaul)s flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Exscinders are Heaven's censors, scouring the planes for texts containing information too evil or dangerous to be allowed to exist. Exscinders care little for individual lives or everyday heresies, remaining staunchly focused on protecting mortalkind as a whole from corruption."

Maixenor slipped the man 5 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Maixenor.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Cudd called out

"Before you go, get rid of that useless sword. It won't make a dent against the carapace of the exscinder." 

"Take this aklys. It has served a well over a dozen adventureres before you and it should serve you well too."

Sheathing his aklys, Maixenor leaves Hershfos on a journey to find the exscinder. 

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Hershfos, he turned to his right and saw something mythological.

## <a name="chapter15"></a> Chapter 15: Pinghburthn's Acton-onumberbone upooth and the Gray Goo

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Pinghburthn's Acton-onumberbone upooth. The raker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a taverner with a barker. While the dog trainer hawked fine imported goods from Welsill, a housewife sat by the side of the road. Maixenor continued down the path. Two bards finished an apple and tossed the core aside.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a tanner. Maixenor approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Maixenor, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Kebad." Maixenor announced.

A fool for money hawked fine imported goods from Hea. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Eustes is into the market and towards the tavern. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the cattle barn and left. You'll see a monastery. It's just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Eustes Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. The mailmaker finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a attendent. Nearby, a chicken butcher finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Eustes looked up from his work behind a counter at Maixenor.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Eustes grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of skavelings and vishaps flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Swarms of weaponized nanites—microscopic mechanical constructs designed to work in large groups to perform varied tasks—reduce anything in their path to wisps of dust. Called "gray goo" by those who don't understand the true nature of the creature's components, some of these horrific swarms were activated as weapons of mass destruction. Others were originally benign, intended to enhance crops and clean them of pests or combat diseases, but malfunctioned and abandoned their programming. Nanites have limited intelligence and potentially respond to commands. Such controlled swarms are capable of relatively complex decision making, and they might spare the treasure their victims carry, for instance, allowing their masters to better loot the bodies."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the gray goo?" Maixenor asked.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Eustes called out

"Before you go, get rid of that useless sword. It won't make a dent against the carapace of the gray goo." 

"Forged by the finest dwarven smiths in the mountains of Wilton-Seveng, this heavy flail is the finest display of craftsmanship for miles around."

With his newfound information, Maixenor departs from Pinghburthn's Acton-onumberbone upooth.

## <a name="chapter16"></a> Chapter 16: Stan and the Thunder Behemoth

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Stan. Nearby, a siege engineer loaded a market stall with wares. Nearby, a pilgrim gazed at him from an open window. Maixenor continued down the path. Nearby, a bricker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a painter.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a upholder. The man, eying his dangerous demeanor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Maixenor, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Kebad." Maixenor announced.

While the jester slept in an alleyway, a papermaker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a rectifier. The man quietly reminised about the pastHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Tankratinus is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Tankratinus Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a wiredrawer eyed him suspiciously. A franklin stood by a market stall, negotiating with the pilot. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Maixenor cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Tankratinus grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of ketesthiuss and unfettered phantoms flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Tankratinus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Thunder behemoths walk the land as little more than roving appetites, driven by an all-consuming hunger to devour every animal, plant, and even building in sight. They indiscriminately gorge their five seemingly bottomless stomachs on forests and jungles, collapse mine and mountain alike in search of ore, and raze settlements and strongholds for the cowering morsels within."

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Tankratinus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Thunder behemoths are sent out by the gods to destroy wicked cities, raze great temples or monuments that offend divine eyes, and otherwise act as instruments of divine wrath either on the surface of a world or just below it. The days before a thunder behemoth arrives are fraught with minor but unnerving earthquakes, mass exoduses of burrowing animals to the surface, and an unexplained increase in fallen trees and sinkholes."

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Tankratinus called out

"Before you go, get rid of that useless sword. It won't make a dent against the carapace of the thunder behemoth." 

"Forged by the finest dwarven smiths in the mountains of Tauld, this ankus is the finest display of craftsmanship for miles around."

Sheathing his ankus, Maixenor leaves Stan on a journey to find the thunder behemoth. 

The ever valorous Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the thunder behemoth.

Not once did he regret his choice to not become a sergeant.

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Stan, he turned to his right and saw something intrepid.

Contrasting against the nearby Pediplains, the great Manningtoch Fjords provided a refreshing view.Maybe they might make for a grand adventure for when Maixenor's current journey is over.

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Stan, he turned to his left and saw something impavid.

## <a name="chapter17"></a> Chapter 17: Hark and the Choker

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Hark. Nearby, a gemcutter scuttled out of his way. A jester eyed him suspiciously. Maixenor continued down the path. A waxchandler slept in an alleyway.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a navigator. Maixenor approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Maixenor, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Kebad." Maixenor announced.

The cutler sat by the side of the road with a engraver. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"Our village of Hark will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is down the street to the cattle barn and left. You'll see a warehouse. It's just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Larent Fine Supplies". You'll find Larent, the best weapons expert we've got. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a mosaic layer rushed by quickly, ignoring him. The plumber ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Albin with a terrazo grinder. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Maixenor cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Larent grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of leucrottas and qallupilluks flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Larent returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Underground predators that often dwell on the outskirts of subterranean ruins or in the deep shadows of nameless cavern outposts, chokers lurk in the darkness and lash out with their long, rubbery arms to grasp prey as it passes by. They seldom attack multiple enemies at once, stalking their quarry until they can isolate a weaker victim from its pack."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the choker so bad?" Maixenor responded.

Larent returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Chokers walk with a disturbing, almost comical gait due to their extremely limber legs. Weighing only 35 pounds and standing no taller than a halfling, chokers have no problem skittering across walls and ceilings, often lodging themselves into shadowy corners, tunnel intersections, walls, or staircases. A choker will attempt to grasp creatures of almost any size, but prefers lone prey of its size or smaller. "

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the choker?" Maixenor asked.

"Chokers appear to have little culture of their own, gathering only briefly to mate before their wanderlust and hunger spurs them again to a solitary existence. Their just-better-than-animalistic intelligence grants them a fascination with the trappings of society even if they do not truly understand it. Accordingly, the grubby lair of a choker (often situated in a difficult-to-reach nook or cranny) usually contains valuable objects such as rings, brooches, cloak clasps, and loose coins gathered from devoured victims." Larent explained.

Maixenor slipped the man 9 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"This fascination occasionally compels a choker to abandon its subterranean home for a closer study of the sunlit world's many civilizations. These chokers feel most at home in the darkened narrow alleyways of human cities, squeezing themselves into sewers, forgotten alcoves, barrels, and similar cramped, overlooked spaces. Chokers prefer to keep hidden during the light of day, emerging from their hidey-holes under cover of darkness to hunt for food and cruel pleasure. Favorite tactics include using their long arms to scoop prey off the street from the safety of a nearby rooftop, attacking sleeping families by squeezing through an open chimney, or tapping on a window to bring their curious food within grasping distance." Larent explained.

Maixenor slipped the man 9 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Larent called out

"Before you go, get rid of that useless sword. It won't make a dent against the carapace of the choker." 

"Take this spring blade. It has served a well over a dozen adventureres before you and it should serve you well too."

With his newfound information, Maixenor departs from Hark. 

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

He met a wandering almoner making his way toward Hark. The stranger said to Maixenor

"I knew a noble hero like you. He met his end far too early. I hope that you are better prepared for your future."

The ever valiant Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the choker.

Not once did Maixenor regret his choice to not become a fabricshearer.

The ever unafraid Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the choker.

Not once did he regret his choice to not become a footpad.

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

Our hero met a wandering player making his way toward Hark. The stranger said to Maixenor

"You must be on your way to kill the choker. I wish you the best of luck!"

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

Maixenor says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Larent was talking about."

## <a name="chapter18"></a> Chapter 18: Woodilinastoninalembley and the Knight Ant

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Woodilinastoninalembley. While the tanner bit into an apple, a ironmonger bit into an apple. While the tapestrymaker gazed at him from an open window, a oil merchant ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Halos. Maixenor continued down the path. Two gunstockers rushed by quickly, ignoring him.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a sergeant. Maixenor approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Kebad has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Maixenor have come to destroy him!" Maixenor exclaimed.

Nearby, a fresco painter stood by a market stall, negotiating with the fabricshearer. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Woodilinastoninalembley will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Xurdas is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Xurdas Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. Two glaziers slowly carried supplies. Two scabbard makers scuttled out of his way. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Maixenor cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Xurdas grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of mindslaver molds and slicer beetles flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "These giant ants use pheromones to organize the complex work and protection of their colonies, identifying insects of their own or allied colonies and warding off intruders. They have a specialized physiology, including both enhanced pheromone glands and an especially wide, oversized head. The sheer size of its head allows a knight ant to block off entire tunnels within the hive in order to protect its fellow ants. It remains in place long enough to fend off invaders, even at the cost of its own life."

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Xurdas returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A knight ant is 10 feet long and weighs approximately 1,100 pounds. Its head is 7 feet across, and the flanges on the sides make it appear slightly concave."

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"That's all I can tell you."

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Xurdas called out

"Wait, you'll need a weapon worthy of your great cause. That rusty sword won't do." 

"Take this crook. It has served a well over a dozen adventureres before you and it should serve you well too."

With his newfound information, Maixenor departs from Woodilinastoninalembley. 

The ever mythological Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the knight ant.

Not once did he regret his choice to not become a lanternmaker.

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

He met a wandering sherrif making his way toward Woodilinastoninalembley. The stranger said to Maixenor

## <a name="chapter19"></a> Chapter 19: Weadder and the Ocean Giant

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Weadder. The summoner scuttled out of his way with a waferer. The sapper stood by a market stall, negotiating with the hawker with a chancellor. Maixenor continued down the path. A saltboiler slowly carried supplies.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a confectioner. Maixenor approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Kebad has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Maixenor have come to destroy him!" Maixenor exclaimed.

The thresher rushed by quickly, ignoring him with a salter. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Kili is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the barn and left. You'll see a tavern. It's into the market and towards the inn. Eventually you need to walk past the church. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Kili Fine Supplies". I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a maidservant scuttled out of his way. Nearby, a silkmaid slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Maixenor cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Kili grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of garden oozes and river drakes flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"Ocean giants embody the great extremes of the sea. Their skin colors vary from deep blue to pale green, and their eyes and hair range from foamy white to coral pink. They decorate themselves with the treasures of the sea, wearing shell jewelry or scrimshaw, and clothing woven from underwater plants, or even salvaged sails. Each ocean giant carries a hand-crafted musical horn made from a conch shell, an object of cultural significance representing its family history and travels on the vast sea." Kili explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the ocean giant?" Maixenor asked.

Kili returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Many ocean giants view themselves as guardians of the sea, its creatures, and those who travel the waves, safeguarding their charges from remarkable coral towers. Others, however, claim domains measuring thousands of leagues, enslaving the beasts and aquatic races within and shattering any ship that dares trespass near their citadels of urchins and bones."

Maixenor slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Kili returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Adult ocean giants stand approximately 22 feet tall and weigh about 15,000 pounds. Most live to be about 500 years old."

Maixenor slipped the man 8 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Maixenor.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Kili called out

"Before you go, get rid of that useless sword. It won't make a dent against the carapace of the ocean giant." 

"Take this elven curve blade. It has served a well over a dozen adventureres before you and it should serve you well too."

Sheathing his elven curve blade, Maixenor leaves Weadder on a journey to find the ocean giant. 

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Weadder, he turned to his left and saw something courageous.

The Plateaus of Ston towered over the nearby Plains.It reminded he of the town of Cock he had visited long ago.

The ever bold Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the ocean giant.

Not once did the adventurer regret his choice to not become a fletcher.

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

The valorous Maixenor met a wandering bronzefounder making his way toward Weadder. The stranger said to Maixenor

"The ocean giant killed my brother. I would be heading back to end that eerie thing if only it hadn't taken my eye the first time I tried."

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Weadder, he turned to his left and saw something classic.

The Vales of Ath towered over the nearby mountain coves.Maybe they might make for a mythological adventure for when Maixenor's current journey is over.

The ever grand Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the ocean giant.

Not once did our hero regret his choice to not become a chandler.

## <a name="chapter20"></a> Chapter 20: Sough Bring Brewton and the Clockwork Dragon

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Sough Bring Brewton. The chaplain talked excitedly with what appeared to be a palmer with a horse trainer. The old-clothes dealer slowly carried supplies with a weeper. Maixenor continued down the path. Two milliners gazed at him from an open window.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a master of hounds. The man, eying his well-made boots, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Kebad took over?" Maixenor asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

While the milliner threw punches, a sergeant slowly carried supplies. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Anastus is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Anastus Fine Supplies". I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. While the bard bit into an apple, a doctor sat by the side of the road. Nearby, a boatman talked excitedly with what appeared to be a drywaller. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Anastus looked up from his work behind a counter at Maixenor.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Anastus grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of titan centipedes and dragon turtles flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"While the clockwork goliaths possess more brute power, clockwork dragons' powerful breath weapons and mastery of flight make them more versatile and graceful killers. Designed for long flights and missions, the intricate winding mechanism of the clockwork dragon is more efficient than that of other clockwork constructs, partially because it reuses some of the energy generated by its intricate wings and the complex machinery of its breath weapon device. One of the most complicated and subtly crafted clockworks, its many moving parts are fortified by adamantine supports and fixtures, making this killing machine a brilliant mix of intricacy and unyielding terror." Anastus explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the clockwork dragon so bad?" Maixenor responded.

"The basic chassis and internal workings of the clockwork dragons are highly adaptable, and many variants of the clockwork dragon exist. Clockwork dragons are typically 20 feet long from snout to the tip of its tail, and weigh nearly 75 tons." Anastus explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the clockwork dragon so bad?" Maixenor responded.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Maixenor.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Anastus called out

"Wait, you'll need a weapon worthy of your great cause. That rusty sword won't do." 

"Forged by the finest dwarven smiths in the mountains of Bospool, this khopesh is the finest display of craftsmanship for miles around."

With his newfound information, Maixenor departs from Sough Bring Brewton. 

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

He met a wandering mathematician making his way toward Sough Bring Brewton. The stranger said to Maixenor

"Take care crossing the Fing Volcanic groups! They are especially dangerous this time of year."

The ever elevated Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the clockwork dragon.

Not once did Maixenor regret his choice to not become a girdler.

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Sough Bring Brewton, he turned to his right and saw something undaunted.

Contrasting against the nearby Tidal marshs, the great Midge Gateat Finghlon-Tren Volcanic islands provided a refreshing view.It reminded he of the town of Lon Rotin-Edholl Tellymoolle Putne he had visited long ago.

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

## <a name="chapter21"></a> Chapter 21: Hillonueedon-on and the Giraffe

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Hillonueedon-on. A linenspinner slept in an alleyway. The exchequer stood by a market stall, negotiating with the drywaller with a shepherd. Maixenor continued down the path. Two singers scuttled out of his way.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a pavyler. Maixenor approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Kebad took over?" Maixenor asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

The fuller eyed him suspiciously with a nakerer. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Taiam is past the stables. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Taiam Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. While the farmer ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Leicristhelypoemodo, a merchant threw punches. Two woolcombers bit into an apple. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Taiam looked up from his work behind a counter at Maixenor.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the frost drake, or perhaps even the cheetah, but that's nothing compared to the giraffe we've got."

"These long-necked animals roam across plains in loose-knit groups, grazing on the upper reaches of acacia trees. Giraffes usually avoid conflict. However, when its young are threatened or if the giraffe is cornered, it attacks ruthlessly, striking with its powerful hooves. Giraffes rarely use their necks to make slam attacks unless they are fighting among themselves as part of their mating displays." Taiam explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the giraffe?" Maixenor asked.

"A giraffe is between 16 and 20 feet tall and weighs 3,500 pounds." Taiam explained.

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Taiam called out

"Wait, you'll need a weapon worthy of your great cause. That rusty sword won't do." 

"Forged by the finest dwarven smiths in the mountains of Glark, this dagger is the finest display of craftsmanship for miles around."

Sheathing his dagger, Maixenor leaves Hillonueedon-on on a journey to find the giraffe. 

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

Maixenor met a wandering mapmaker making his way toward Hillonueedon-on. The stranger said to Maixenor

"The giraffe killed my brother. I would be heading back to end that abhorrent thing if only it hadn't taken my eye the first time I tried."

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

Maixenor met a wandering lapidary making his way toward Hillonueedon-on. The stranger said to Maixenor

"I knew a gallant hero like you. He met his end far too early. I hope that you are better prepared for your future."

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Hillonueedon-on, he turned to his right and saw something courageous.

Maixenor could barely make out some Tessellated pavements in the distance.It reminded he of the town of Wootholds he had visited long ago.

The ever bold Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the giraffe.

Not once did Maixenor the stouthearted regret his choice to not become a drywaller.

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

The fearless Maixenor met a wandering pardoner making his way toward Hillonueedon-on. The stranger said to Maixenor

"Take care crossing the Sunlaccast Mountain passes! They are especially dangerous this time of year."

Maixenor saw a lurid giraffe in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the mean sight. The inflated Maixenor approched the giraffe cautiously, careful not to rush to an untimely death.

After a seemingly eternal amount of combat, a victor emerged. The giraffe was slain.

Maixenor says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Taiam was talking about."

## <a name="chapter22"></a> Chapter 22: Easion-Ter and the Catoblepas

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Easion-Ter. While the rugmaker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a tapestrymaker, a barrister hawked fine imported goods from Doln. A glover scuttled out of his way. Maixenor continued down the path. A drywaller hawked fine imported goods from Queen.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a boatman. The man, eying his unusual weapons, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Kebad took over?" Maixenor asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a halberdier finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The man sat in silence for a whileHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. You'll find Averamnes, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. Two crofters ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Diodoridus. Two gamekeepers finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Averamnes looked up from his work behind a counter at Maixenor.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the shinigami, or perhaps even the akaname, but that's nothing compared to the catoblepas we've got."

Averamnes returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The catoblepas is an aggressive beast at the best of times, willing to knock down trees, fences, even small houses to eat whatever it finds interesting, be that meal plant or animal or human being. Though it prefers swamps, the catoblepas has been known to forage in plains and forests for short periods before returning to the buoyant support of water and mud. Few creatures linger near a catoblepas's feeding ground because of the monster's bad temper and poisonous breath, and only rot-loving predators such as oozes or exceptionally large otyughs have any interest in hunting them."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the catoblepas?" Maixenor asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "A catoblepas' primary motivation is hunting and exerting its dominance over lesser creatures in its territory. Easily detected by its foul odor, the creature tolerates the presence of wild animals, humanoid tribes, and even predators that it can bully as long as these things flee or act submissive when the poisonous brute lumbers into view. The catoblepas is known to engage in physical battles with other Large swamp creatures such as crocodiles or even froghemoths. Some humanoid tribes claim to know techniques to domesticate a catoblepas for use as a guard animal, but the monster's intractable nature and not insignificant intelligence almost certainly means magic is involved, as the creature has little need for alliances and can wipe out entire villages with its breath. Some have been known to use their breath underwater, creating a churning cloud of bubbles that kills fish in the area and starves out other creatures."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the catoblepas so bad?" Maixenor responded.

Averamnes returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A catoblepas's sense of smell is blunted by its own ungodly stench, and it can't easily recognize rival odors such as skunk musk (though this provides the beast no immunity to odor-based effects from other creatures)."

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Averamnes returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A catoblepas is 15 feet long and weighs 2,200 pounds."

Maixenor slipped the man 4 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Maixenor.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Averamnes called out

"Before you go, get rid of that useless sword. It won't make a dent against the carapace of the catoblepas." 

"Take this sickle-sword. It has served a well over a dozen adventureres before you and it should serve you well too."

With his newfound information, Maixenor departs from Easion-Ter. 

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Easion-Ter, he turned to his left and saw something unafraid.

The Headlands of Weyne towered over the nearby Escarpments.Maybe they might make for a fearless adventure for when Maixenor's current journey is over.

The ever fire-eating Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the catoblepas.

Not once did the bold Maixenor regret his choice to not become a thresher.

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

He met a wandering tallowchandler making his way toward Easion-Ter. The stranger said to Maixenor

"I knew a epic hero like you. He met his end far too early. I hope that you are better prepared for your future."

The catoblepas eyed Maixenor with a dangerous glare. The catoblepas struck with its bite! The fierce blow from the monster narrowly misses he. 

Maixenor the fearless made a mighty swing at the catoblepas with this sickle-sword. Maixenor the grandiose landed a massive hit on catoblepas! 

Maixenor's last strike hit the catoblepas directly in the heary. A fatal blow.

Maixenor says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Averamnes was talking about."

## <a name="chapter23"></a> Chapter 23: Aldsinge and the Vukodlak

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Aldsinge. While the cantor slept in an alleyway, a boatman bit into an apple. Two jewelers slowly carried supplies. Maixenor continued down the path. A bearleader finished an apple and tossed the core aside.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a beekeeper. The man, eying his well-made boots, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Kebad took over?" Maixenor asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Two heralds talked excitedly with what appeared to be a harper. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Maixenor. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is past the monastery. There's a small door. You'll find Cissiones, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. While the joiner gazed at him from an open window, a archer sat by the side of the road. Two spinsters loaded a market stall with wares. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Cissiones looked up from his work behind a counter at Maixenor.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the marilith, or perhaps even the saxra, but that's nothing compared to the vukodlak we've got."

"Vukodlaks spawn from the malignant spirits of powerful, intelligent, wolflike creatures such as worgs, winter wolves, or werewolves. Often they arise from such creatures that—through desperation or depravity—fed on undead flesh or drank the blood of a vampiric creature. Their blackened souls arise after death, twisting their bodies into monstrous shapes. Like vampires, vukodlaks share an insatiable thirst for blood." Cissiones explained.

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Vukodlaks measure 8 feet long and 6 feet tall at the shoulder, and they weigh 1,000 pounds. A vukodlak typically walks on all fours, and from a distance can easily be mistaken for a large, shaggy horse. However, it has a distinct wolflike muzzle filled with sharp canine teeth, as well as other wolfish features. Vukodlaks possess monstrous strength, making them ideal mounts for powerful undead masters or other evil creatures. While serving as mounts, they keep to all fours, and might easily be mistaken for worgs or great fanged horses. Masters seeking to control vukodlaks find the most success relying on fear and intimidation, as well as providing a constant source of blood for the creature to feed upon. Vukodlaks share a natural kinship with vampires and often serve them willingly."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the vukodlak so bad?" Maixenor responded.

"Vukodlaks hunger for blood, gorging themselves rather than saving victims to feed on later. When feeding, they can prove difficult to command. Riders who are not careful in their attempts to restrain a hungry vukodlak risk having their mount turn on them. While vukodlaks can go days without feeding, they gradually become weaker if they do not feed daily, and have difficulty operating on anything other than pure instinct. Though intelligent, vukodlaks rarely think or plan ahead, instead focusing on feeding or obeying their masters' commands." Cissiones explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the vukodlak?" Maixenor asked.

"Vukodlaks without masters often form small packs. These packs annihilate all life in entire areas, overfeeding until destroyed or forced to move on. Vukodlaks hate sunlight and hunt only at night, making their lairs in deep caves or ruins. They don't care for treasure; anything of worth found in a vukodlak lair is simply something its latest victim was carrying that the beast couldn't eat." Cissiones explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the vukodlak so bad?" Maixenor responded.

Cissiones returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Although vukodlaks don't appear undead at first glance, any creature that wounds one or finds a vukodlak corpse can tell they're not living creatures—their bodies being largely hollow, filled with the rotten, stinking remains of organs that ceased functioning long ago."

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Maixenor.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Cissiones called out

"Before you go, get rid of that useless sword. It won't make a dent against the carapace of the vukodlak." 

"Take this orc double axe. It has served a well over a dozen adventureres before you and it should serve you well too."

Sheathing his orc double axe, Maixenor leaves Aldsinge on a journey to find the vukodlak. 

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Aldsinge, he turned to his left and saw something gutty.

Some distant Domes stood out against the horizon.It reminded our hero of the town of Sunton he had visited long ago.

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

Maixenor met a wandering oil merchant making his way toward Aldsinge. The stranger said to Maixenor

"I knew a fearless hero like you. He met his end far too early. I hope that you are better prepared for your future."

The ever epic Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the vukodlak.

Not once did he regret his choice to not become a panter.

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Aldsinge, he turned to his left and saw something valorous.

He could barely make out some Swamps in the distance.It reminded he of the town of Oly Road-dÃ»m he had visited long ago.

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Aldsinge, he turned to his right and saw something grandiose.

Contrasting against the nearby Desert pavements, the great St. Juntreens Abyssal fans provided a refreshing view.It reminded the adventurer of the town of Maner he had visited long ago.

Maixenor saw a horrendous vukodlak in the distance! Our hero readied his sword. Maixenor hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Maixenor took a deep breath and swung toward the repellent vukodlak. That blow seemed like it could break some bones. Struck by the hefty blow, the vukodlak needed a second to recover its footing. Maixenor the tall standing made a mighty swing at the vukodlak with this orc double axe. Maixenor's strike glanced off of the vukodlak's hide. 

A powerful swing came from the vukodlak with very deadly intent. The fierce blow from the monster narrowly misses he. The adventurer leaned on his orc double axe to catch a moment's respite. He was worn out by the combat. The vukodlak leans low, ready to strike with its might. 

A powerful swing came from the vukodlak with very deadly intent. The fierce blow from the monster narrowly misses the grand Maixenor. Maixenor lunged toward the vukodlak, his orc double axe ready to strike! The vukodlak was staggered by the immense force. 

The vukodlak eyed Maixenor with a dangerous glare. The vukodlak struck with its bite! He jumps out of the way. 

He held his orc double axe tightly, ready to block any attack. A impavid attack suddenly came from Maixenor, its intent to silence the ungodly beast once and for all. A sharp crack was heard as the strike left its mark. 

Maixenor lunged toward the vukodlak, his orc double axe ready to strike! The vukodlak was staggered by the immense force. 

Maixenor's last strike hit the vukodlak directly in the heary. A fatal blow.

The citizens of Aldsinge could sleep soundly at night. He had vanquished their greatest nightmare.

## <a name="chapter24"></a> Chapter 24: Bebor and the Tengu

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Bebor. Nearby, a bailiff eyed him suspiciously. A ditcher sat by the side of the road. Maixenor continued down the path. Nearby, a papermaker gazed at him from an open window.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a carpenter. Maixenor approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Kebad has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Maixenor have come to destroy him!" Maixenor exclaimed.

The alchemist bit into an apple with a farrier. The man quietly reminised about the pastHe finally responded.

"Our village of Bebor will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Alkmaios is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. A horner bit into an apple. Two besom makers rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Maixenor cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Alkmaios lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The tengu."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Tengus are a race of avian humanoids that resemble crows or ravens, and often bear much of the same stigma. Though they frequently choose to live among other races in densely populated cities, their society is tight and closed, and they rarely allow others to see its inner workings. Tengus often band together in small groups to create roosts in vacant warehouses or condemned buildings, and these raucous gathering places are generally assumed to be thieves' guilds by outsiders—an assumption that's correct roughly half the time."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the tengu so bad?" Maixenor responded.

"Like the crows they share physical traits with, tengus are naturally covetous, especially of shiny or colorful items, and prone to bouts of good-natured kleptomania if they don't carefully keep themselves in check. Vain and prideful creatures, they are easily persuaded with flattery." Alkmaios explained.

Maixenor slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Alkmaios called out

"Before you go, get rid of that useless sword. It won't make a dent against the carapace of the tengu." 

"Forged by the finest dwarven smiths in the mountains of Oly Crodsize Streens, this warhammer is the finest display of craftsmanship for miles around."

Sheathing his warhammer, Maixenor leaves Bebor on a journey to find the tengu. 

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Bebor, he turned to his right and saw something daring.

Some distant Crevasses stood out against the horizon.Maybe they might make for a gallant adventure for when Maixenor's current journey is over.

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

He met a wandering playwright making his way toward Bebor. The stranger said to Maixenor

"The tengu killed my brother. I would be heading back to end that sickie thing if only it hadn't taken my eye the first time I tried."

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

Our hero met a wandering dean making his way toward Bebor. The stranger said to Maixenor

"I knew a classic hero like you. He met his end far too early. I hope that you are better prepared for your future."

The ever valorous Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the tengu.

Not once did our hero regret his choice to not become a sheepshearer.

As Maixenor walked along the path out of Bebor, he turned to his right and saw something dauntless.

The Desert pavements of Oxfor towered over the nearby Tors.Maybe they might make for a doughty adventure for when Maixenor's current journey is over.

Maixenor saw a offensive tengu in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the ungodly sight. Maixenor hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The tengu struck with its dagger! Maixenor reeled back in pain. The exhilarating combat made the hours seem like seconds. The tengu struck with its dagger! The fearless Maixenor stunbles backward, gasping for breath. 

A powerful swing came from the tengu with very deadly intent. The adventurer jumps out of the way. The exhilarating combat made the hours seem like seconds. The tengu leans low, ready to strike with its might.

The tengu struck with its dagger! He stunbles backward, gasping for breath. The exhilarating combat made the hours seem like seconds. The tengu leans low, ready to strike with its might. 

The warhammer of Maixenor was raised high only to be brought down onto the tengu moments later. The tengu took a glancing blow. Struck by the hefty blow, the tengu needed a second to recover its footing. He pulled a buff potion from his pack and drinks it. He is reinvigorated. 

The hideous monster took a swipe at Maixenor. The fierce blow from the monster narrowly misses he. A exaggerated attack suddenly came from Maixenor, its intent to silence the unholy beast once and for all. That blow seemed like it could break some bones. 

The tengu eyed Maixenor with a dangerous glare. A gallant attack suddenly came from Maixenor, its intent to silence the unholy beast once and for all. The tengu was struck by the blow!

The tengu struck with its dagger! The adventurer blocks the strike with his warhammer. The exhilarating combat made the hours seem like seconds. The tengu struck with its dagger! Maixenor the fearless blocks the strike with his warhammer. 

Maixenor took a deep breath and swung toward the awful tengu. The shattering blow from he rumbled through the ground. 

Covered with wounds and bruises, the offensive tengu fell over for the last time.

He was victorious! The tengu menaced for no longer! 

## <a name="chapter25"></a> Chapter 25: Kham and the Vishap

Maixenor followed a dirt path into the village of Kham. Nearby, a pursuivant loaded a market stall with wares. A gluttonous fool loaded a market stall with wares. Maixenor continued down the path. Nearby, a begger slept in an alleyway.

Eventually, Maixenor arrived at the town square, where he found a pavyler. The man, eying his dangerous demeanor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Kebad has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Maixenor have come to destroy him!" Maixenor exclaimed.

While the scout ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Wintxo, a belter bit into an apple. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Kham will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Guardus is past the tavern. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Maixenor hurried towards the armory. Two pastrycooks finished an apple and tossed the core aside. A tanner gazed at him from an open window. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Maixenor cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Maixenor, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Kebad. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the jungle giant, or perhaps even the shinigami, but that's nothing compared to the vishap we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Vishaps think of themselves as guardians of the ley lines that connect the life forces of the Material Plane to one another. Like all dragons, vishaps claim expansive territories, but these territories often make little geographical sense to others—a single vishap might claim unconnected areas on different hemispheres of a planet, for example, and yet multiple vishaps sometimes coexist within mere miles of each other with no apparent animosity. To those attuned to the occult mysteries of ley lines, however, the vishaps' territorial borders are clear. Each vishap claims one or more networks of ley lines, which may stretch for thousands of miles (or even across galaxies), and sometimes overlap with each other without ever touching. A vishap's first priority is the integrity of its ley line network, so any corruption of a ley line draws the attention of the vishap that cares for it."

Maixenor slipped the man 7 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Vishaps claim only small physical territories in places where their ley lines coincide with interesting geography. In these places, vishaps make psychic contact with intelligent creatures nearby, encouraging them to create standing stones called vishapakars. A vishap can't place a vishapakar on its own, but the presence of a vishapakar on a ley line allows the vishap a great deal of control over that ley line. Evil or less diplomatic vishaps often travel to these desirable locations to intimidate the local people into appeasing the dragons with standing stones. Vishapakars can stand for thousands of years, even as the ley lines that they once marked drift and change course, so a vishap must return to each vishapakar periodically, entreating (or forcing) locals to create new vishapakars on the ley lines' new locations. At particularly ancient locations, it is possible to map the gradual drift of ley lines by the age of the nearby vishapakars."

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Vishaps become deeply attached to their ley line networks over their millennia-long life spans, and can live peacefully alongside other vishaps with nearby networks. When ley lines drift and converge, however, it often results in a mortal duel. Sometimes this happens as a corporeal battle in the skies of a planet, or between the dragons while in their ethereal forms. Most commonly, vishaps engaged in mortal combat for control of converging ley lines meet each other in elaborate psychic duels. These duels can last for years, and often spill over into the Material Plane, with each vishap subtly manipulating the creatures and locations along the converging ley lines in a proxy war to defeat its opponent." Guardus explained.

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Vishaps keep their treasure hoards, like their territories, in strange places, hidden in eddies of psychic energy along their favorite ley lines. A vishap's hoard might be physically scattered across dozens of planes, though to the vishap each cache is only minutes away from the others. A vishap favors items of psychic significance, so one is as likely to find a mundane wooden spoon that belonged to a powerful occultist or the skull of a famous psychic in a vishap's hoard as a magical sword or mountains of gold."

Maixenor slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Guardus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Vishaps procreate only once during their lives, as tending to their ley lines takes priority over almost any biological imperative. When a vishap is finally ready to mate, it commits its form wholly to the ley line network, drifting listlessly along the psychic currents. Inevitably, it meets with some other drifting vishap, and the two consciousnesses merge, exploding in a spray of psychic force. The resulting motes of ethereal energy scatter across the universe, slowly drifting back toward each other and forming eggs, which sometimes drift along ley lines for millennia before hatching a young, ethereal vishap that awakens to full consciousness upon hatching."

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "A fully grown vishap is 70 feet from head to tail and weighs 60,000 pounds."

Maixenor looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Maixenor.

As Maixenor turned to leave the armory, Guardus called out

"Wait, you'll need a weapon worthy of your great cause. That rusty sword won't do." 

"Take this heavy spiked shield. It has served a well over a dozen adventureres before you and it should serve you well too."

Sheathing his heavy spiked shield, Maixenor leaves Kham on a journey to find the vishap. 

Continuing along the path, Maixenor crossed paths with another traveler.

He met a wandering stillroom maid making his way toward Kham. The stranger said to Maixenor

"I knew a noble hero like you. He met his end far too early. I hope that you are better prepared for your future."

The ever valorous Maixenor continued his long and tiring journey to find the vishap.

Not once did our hero regret his choice to not become a netmaker.

Maixenor saw a frightful vishap in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the loathsome sight. Maixenor the fire-eating approched the vishap cautiously, careful not to rush to an untimely death. 

He sneaked around to vishap's blind spot. The vishap struck with its bite! He blocks the strike with his heavy spiked shield.
