# Fluvand's Journey to Defeat the Evil Wizard Tibbon _(and his many battles along the way)_

## <a name="chapter1"></a> Chapter 1: Foring Her and the Cacodaemon

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Foring Her. A potboy scuttled out of his way. Nearby, a clothier eyed him suspiciously. Fluvand continued down the path. Nearby, a chamberlain talked excitedly with what appeared to be a beerbrewer.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a pissprophet. The man, eying his foreboding cloak, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Tibbon took over?" Fluvand asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

A halberdier slept in an alleyway. He still looked suspiciousHe finally responded.

"Our village of Betster Parsbrien Couces will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is past the inn. There's a small door. You'll find Frith, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. A pavyler eyed him suspiciously. A monk gazed at him from an open window. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Frith looked up from his work behind a counter at Fluvand.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Frith lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The cacodaemon."

Frith returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Any evil outsider can, as a standard action, ingest a soul gem. Doing so frees the soul within, but condemns it to one of the lower planes (though the soul can be returned to life as normal). The outsider gains fast healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to its Hit Dice."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the cacodaemon?" Fluvand asked.

Frith returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The least of daemonkind, cacodaemons spawn from eddies of angry, violent, and demented souls amid the mists of Abaddon. Dim-witted but utterly evil, they endlessly seek to cause pain and indulge their hunger for mortal souls. Many more powerful fiends keep cacodaemons as pets, if only to be able to harvest the tiny creatures' soul gems. A 7th-level spellcaster can gain a cacodaemon as a familiar if she has the Improved Familiar feat."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the cacodaemon?" Fluvand asked.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Fluvand saw a horrid cacodaemon in the distance! He readied his sword. Fluvand hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

He sneaked around to cacodaemon's blind spot. The cacodaemon struck with its bite! Fluvand the grandioseour hero stunbles backward, gasping for breath. 

The cacodaemon leans low, ready to strike with its might. Fluvand lunged toward the cacodaemon, his sword ready to strike! The shattering blow from the adventurer rumbled through the ground. 

The cacodaemon leans low, ready to strike with its might. The cacodaemon struck with its bite! He stunbles backward, gasping for breath. 

The cacodaemon leans low, ready to strike with its might. Fluvand lunged toward the cacodaemon, his sword ready to strike! A sharp crack was heard as the strike left its mark. 

The cacodaemon struck with its bite! The obnoxious cacodaemon failed to land its hit. the elevated Fluvand stumbles to his knee, gasping for breath. The cacodaemon leans low, ready to strike with its might. 

The cacodaemon struck with its bite! The scary cacodaemon failed to land its hit. He leaned on his sword to catch a moment's respite. He was worn out by the combat. The cacodaemon struck with its bite! Fluvand stunbles backward, gasping for breath. 

Fluvand says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Frith was talking about."

## <a name="chapter2"></a> Chapter 2: Hile and the Dire Ape (gigantopithecus)

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Hile. The astronomer ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Dama with a purse maker. Nearby, a stillroom maid talked excitedly with what appeared to be a bodger. Fluvand continued down the path. The currier eyed him suspiciously with a gemcutter.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a woodturner. Fluvand approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Fluvand, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Tibbon." Fluvand announced.

While the taverner hawked fine imported goods from She-Hill, a tentsman gazed at him from an open window. He still looked suspicious, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Fluvand. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Paschard is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 10 small coins. "I want that Tibbon gone as much as anybody."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. Two potboys eyed him suspiciously. Two rugmakers loaded a market stall with wares. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Paschard looked up from his work behind a counter at Fluvand.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the jiang-shi, or perhaps even the warsworn, but that's nothing compared to the dire ape (gigantopithecus) we've got."

"Known to many scholars as the gigantopithecus, the dire ape is a much more dangerous and bestial creature than the relatively peaceful gorilla. An adult male dire ape stands 9 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds. The dire ape attacks anything that intrudes on its territory, including other dire apes not of its troop, and does not break off the attack until the trespasser is dead or runs off." Paschard explained.

Fluvand slipped the man 7 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

The armorer sighed and continued. "A dire ape makes no displays of toughness or warnings before it attacks—it simply leaps into action with little or no provocation, tearing at its opponents with claws and teeth. If a dire ape is stymied by a heavily armored foe, it attempts to grapple its foe, pin it to the ground, and rend it."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the dire ape (gigantopithecus)?" Fluvand asked.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Fluvand saw a execrable dire ape (gigantopithecus) in the distance! Fluvand the intrepidour hero readied his sword. Fluvand hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Fluvand lunged toward the dire ape (gigantopithecus), his sword ready to strike! The slippery dire ape (gigantopithecus) evaded Fluvand's hit. The dire ape (gigantopithecus) struck with its bite!

Fluvand says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Paschard was talking about."

## <a name="chapter3"></a> Chapter 3: Cam Hightsby and the Slithering Tracker

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Cam Hightsby. While the rat catcher hawked fine imported goods from Sunlaccas Pand, a mercer scuttled out of his way. Nearby, a friar ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Meric. Fluvand continued down the path. A crossbowman hawked fine imported goods from Dudbrione.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a scabbard maker. The man, eying his unusual weapons, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Tibbon has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Fluvand have come to destroy him!" Fluvand exclaimed.

While the famulus loaded a market stall with wares, a purse maker eyed him suspiciously. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Scushfier will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Formos is down the street to the warehouse and left. You'll see a monastery. It's into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk past the tavern. It's just to the left. Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. Two bowmans eyed him suspiciously. While the chandler threw punches, a exchequer sat by the side of the road. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Fluvand cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the taotieh, or perhaps even the stone golem, but that's nothing compared to the slithering tracker we've got."

Formos returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "An alien inhabitant of the dark underworld, the slithering tracker is a glistening creature of transparent ooze, typically about 3 inches thick and at least 3 feet in diameter. When still, it looks like a wet patch of stone or a patch of condensation on a wall. Comparatively slow moving, the slithering tracker relies on its transparency and knack for ambushing to surprise prey."

Fluvand looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Once a slithering tracker has paralyzed a living creature, it flows over an exposed patch of flesh, grabbing on and draining blood from the victim. A slithering tracker can drain a human-sized creature of its blood with shocking swiftness, leaving only a desiccated carcass behind. A slithering tracker can go some time between meals, but never turns down easy prey. The larger a slithering tracker grows, the more voracious its appetite becomes, until, after a particularly large feeding, the creature splits into two smaller slithering trackers that eventually go their separate ways in search of feeding territory."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the slithering tracker so bad?" Fluvand responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Slithering trackers are not harmed by bright light, but still prefer to avoid areas of intense illumination or natural sunlight, and so only venture aboveground at night. They prefer the cool, damp environment of their native caves and tunnels."

Fluvand slipped the man 4 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Although intelligent and cunning, slithering trackers are entirely alien creatures. They do not possess any language of their own, although they can usually understand the dominant language of the region they dwell in—usually Undercommon. Some underworld inhabitants do manage to forge alliances with slithering trackers, or at least exist with them in symbiosis by providing the creatures with easy and regular prey, but as one can never truly know a slithering tracker's desires or motivations, such alliances are dangerous to rely upon." Formos explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the slithering tracker?" Fluvand asked.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Fluvand saw a unkind slithering tracker in the distance! Fluvand the fire-eatingour hero readied his sword. Fluvand hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter4"></a> Chapter 4: Havonsbridge Park and the Tojanida

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Havonsbridge Park. The pavior loaded a market stall with wares with a alchemist. While the clockmaker rushed by quickly, ignoring him, a ragpicker slowly carried supplies. Fluvand continued down the path. Nearby, a chainmaker eyed him suspiciously.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a weaver. Fluvand approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Fluvand, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Tibbon." Fluvand announced.

The blockcutter bit into an apple with a pavior. The man quietly reminised about the pastHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Fluvand. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Villmon is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the barn and left. You'll see a stables. It's down the street to the inn and right. You'll see a monastery. It's down the street to the cattle barn and right. You'll see a cattle barn. It's past the barn. There's a small door. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. Two bearleaders loaded a market stall with wares. Two tallowchandlers gazed at him from an open window. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Fluvand cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Villmon lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The tojanida."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Tojanidas are bizarre natives from the Plane of Water that resemble mixes between monstrous crabs and enormous snapping turtles. Originally elemental beings of water, tojanidas were bound into their strange forms long ago for unclear reasons, and no longer know how they might eventually return to their pure and formless state. Determined to preserve their pride, the grotesque tojanidas ply the waters of the planes seeking hedonistic pleasures—especially culinary ones—and the adoration of other races. Loquacious when addressed with the proper respect, they make excellent heralds and emissaries for more powerful beings, and often enjoy posing as such even when operating on their own. When riled, however, tojanidas make fearsome opponents, violent and eager juggernauts with snapping jaws and clacking pincers."

Fluvand slipped the man 7 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Adult tojanidas are roughly 6 feet long and weigh several hundred pounds. When threatened, a tojanida can retract its limbs most of the way into its shell, which is an irremovable part of its body. The ring of eyes completely encircling the tojanida's shell along its rim makes the creature extremely difficult to catch by surprise. While tojanidas adore eating, as they find flavor and texture to be two of the most fascinating senses, they don't actually need to consume food, instead drawing sustenance directly from the currents of arcane energy all around them via the magic of their shells." Villmon explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the tojanida?" Fluvand asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Blessed (some might say cursed) with extremely long racial memories, tojanidas wander the oceans and lakes of innumerable worlds, attempting to find unusual physical pleasures or conversation capable of distracting them from the insufferable ennui and apathy born of remembering their ancestors' experiences. Though the tojanidas themselves may not appreciate the burden of memory, adventurers and scholars often seek the use of a tojanida's recalled lore."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the tojanida?" Fluvand asked.

"That's all I can tell you."

Fluvand saw a evil tojanida in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the fairy sight. Fluvand hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

He sneaked around to tojanida's blind spot. The tojanida leans low, ready to strike with its might.

## <a name="chapter5"></a> Chapter 5: Ath and the Bearded Devil (barbazu)

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Ath. Nearby, a ship's captain slept in an alleyway. While the rivener ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Adrandoaldus, a pilot talked excitedly with what appeared to be a lighter man. Fluvand continued down the path. While the grinder ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Abelar, a rivener slept in an alleyway.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a halberdier. Fluvand approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Tibbon took over?" Fluvand asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a costermonger eyed him suspiciously. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Brow Censt will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Eginrad is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the monastery and left. You'll see a church. It's into the market and towards the tavern. Eventually you need to walk past the monastery. There's a small door. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. A dentist rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Nearby, a saltboiler sat by the side of the road. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Eginrad looked up from his work behind a counter at Fluvand.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the giant stag beetle, or perhaps even the incubus, but that's nothing compared to the bearded devil (barbazu) we've got."

"Elite warriors in Hell's legions, bearded devils—or barbazus—fight savagely in the name of their infernal lords and command mindless hordes of the damned into battle. They collect and train with their infernally forged glaives among the vaults of Hell's third layer, Erebus, but inevitably return to the first layer, Avernus, to serve at the side of the dread lord Barbatos." Eginrad explained.

Fluvand slipped the man 5 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Barbazus are fond of making charge attacks with their glaives, and try to maintain a 10-foot gap between themselves and their foes so they can use their signature polearms to great effect. Against a foe that has greater reach (or one able to otherwise avoid the devil's favored tactic), they drop their glaives and resort to their claws and hideous beards."

Fluvand slipped the man 10 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Eginrad returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "At attention, bearded devils stand over 6 feet tall (though their squatting battle stances often make them appear shorter) and weigh upward of 200 pounds."

Fluvand looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Fluvand.

Fluvand saw a eerie bearded devil (barbazu) in the distance! He readied his sword. Fluvand hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter6"></a> Chapter 6: Lorlon and the Ice Linnorm

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Lorlon. Nearby, a bishop bit into an apple. The canon loaded a market stall with wares with a currier. Fluvand continued down the path. A bodger talked excitedly with what appeared to be a costermonger.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a wood seller. Fluvand approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Fluvand, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Tibbon." Fluvand announced.

While the chainmaker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a pattenmaker, a hurdle maker hawked fine imported goods from Sough. The man quietly reminised about the pastHe finally responded.

"Our village of Burgulhawley Road will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Cleomeninos is past the monastery. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 7 small coins. "I want that Tibbon gone as much as anybody."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a rugmaker threw punches. While the pilot bit into an apple, a cook threw punches. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Fluvand cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the crag linnorm, or perhaps even the charda, but that's nothing compared to the ice linnorm we've got."

Cleomeninos returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The ice linnorm dwells amid glacial crevasses and atop wind-blasted mountain peaks—tales speak of climbers unwittingly clambering over the flanks of a particularly immense ice linnorm coiled around a mountain, only to find death at its furious fangs and claws at the summit of their goal. During the fiercest winters, ice linnorms are said to slither down to the lowlands to eat entire villages."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the ice linnorm so bad?" Fluvand responded.

"An ice linnorm is 90 feet long and weighs 18,000 pounds." Cleomeninos explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the ice linnorm?" Fluvand asked.

"That's all I can tell you."

## <a name="chapter7"></a> Chapter 7: Ley Pood and the Adult Green Dragon

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Ley Pood. Two poets threw punches. Two tentsmans loaded a market stall with wares. Fluvand continued down the path. Nearby, a miner slept in an alleyway.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a sawyer. Fluvand approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Tibbon took over?" Fluvand asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

A locksmith loaded a market stall with wares. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Gool Hill will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Straitzki is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Straitzki Fine Supplies". And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 7 small coins. "I want that Tibbon gone as much as anybody."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a parker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a combmaker. Nearby, a curate stood by a market stall, negotiating with the goatherd. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Fluvand cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Straitzki grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of boilborns and lunarmas flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Straitzki returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The monster adult green dragon is terrifying for sure, but I honestly don't know much about that beast."

Fluvand slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Fluvand saw a ghastly adult green dragon in the distance! He readied his sword. Fluvand hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

Fluvand says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Straitzki was talking about."

## <a name="chapter8"></a> Chapter 8: Tufne and the Ice Troll

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Tufne. While the maid slept in an alleyway, a confectioner hawked fine imported goods from Bandstbort Road. While the merchant taylor rushed by quickly, ignoring him, a horner loaded a market stall with wares. Fluvand continued down the path. Two jailers slept in an alleyway.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a stonecutter. The man, eying his impressive armor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Tibbon took over?" Fluvand asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a pursuivant talked excitedly with what appeared to be a camp follower. He still looked suspicious, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Fluvand. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the church. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the stables. Eventually you need to walk past the monastery. It's just to the left. You'll find Bion, the best weapons expert we've got. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. The scout bit into an apple with a lacemaker. Nearby, a saltboiler hawked fine imported goods from Grebderborow. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Fluvand cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Bion lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The ice troll."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Ice trolls are somewhat smaller than normal trolls, but they possess greater intelligence and cunning and are just as voraciously hungry. They display the typical hunched posture of trolls, combined with long arms tipped with sharp claws and the distinctive troll underbite. Like normal trolls, ice trolls possess amazing regenerative powers that enable them to recover from almost any wound. Unlike most trolls, ice trolls often use weapons in battle, but in the heat of combat, they often cast aside weapons in favor of their rending claws. An ice troll stands about 10 feet tall and weighs up to 900 pounds."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the ice troll?" Fluvand asked.

"Because of their greater intellects, ice trolls sometimes work as mercenaries, and often serve as soldiers in monstrous armies. They frequently ally with frost giants, and may even be found among northern barbarian tribes, as long as they are well fed and well paid." Bion explained.

Fluvand slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Ice trolls enjoy the taste of human flesh, and those not working with humans frequently set traps near civilized areas to catch their favorite prey. They will also raid isolated settlements for food, often bringing captured humans back to their icy lairs, where the unfortunate victims are caged and fattened up before finally being devoured by the voracious trolls."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the ice troll?" Fluvand asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "In combat, ice trolls are more cautious than normal trolls. They do not normally rush headlong into battle, instead focusing on weaker foes or those bearing fire. They do not hesitate to attack opponents armed with fire, but work together to defeat such enemies before they can bring their dangerous weapons to bear."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the ice troll?" Fluvand asked.

Bion returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Ice troll society is more patriarchal than normal troll society, and while males may form gangs to hunt or raid, most ice trolls live in small family groups comprised of a male, a female, and their offspring."

Fluvand slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Fluvand.

## <a name="chapter9"></a> Chapter 9: Ham and the Ghost

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Ham. A hobbler loaded a market stall with wares. A architect finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Fluvand continued down the path. A peasant sat by the side of the road.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a nedeller. The man, eying his dangerous demeanor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Tibbon took over?" Fluvand asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a woodcarver eyed him suspiciously. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Ruishord's Wembelde will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is down the street to the tavern and right. You'll see a barn. It's just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. You'll find Mahus, the best weapons expert we've got. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 5 small coins. "I want that Tibbon gone as much as anybody."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. The tinsmith loaded a market stall with wares with a beadle. Two philosophers finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Fluvand cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Mahus lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The ghost."

The armorer sighed and continued. "When a soul is not allowed to rest due to some great injustice, either real or perceived, it sometimes comes back as a ghost. Such beings are in eternal anguish, lacking in substance and unable to set things right. Although ghosts can be any alignment, the majority cling to the living world out of a powerful sense of rage and hatred, and as a result are chaotic evil—even the ghost of a good or lawful creature can become hateful and cruel in its afterlife."

Fluvand slipped the man 2 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Mahus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "More than most of the monsters in this book, a ghost benefits from a strong and detailed backstory. Why did this character become a ghost? What are the legends surrounding the ghost? An encounter with a ghost should never happen completely out of the blue—there are plenty of other incorporeal undead like wraiths and spectres to fill that role. A proper encounter with a ghost should be a climactic scene after a lengthy period of tension building with lesser minions or manifestations of the undead spirit. The sample ghost above is that of a human princess who was murdered by an unfaithful lover—after she confronted him, he murdered her by wrapping her in chains and throwing her into the castle well, where she drowned. The ghost's abilities were selected to fit this backstory, and it shows how potent a villain you can create with a simple NPC class. Applying the template to creatures with class levels or creatures with significant racial abilities can create even more powerful ghosts."

Fluvand looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"When a ghost is created, it retains incorporeal "copies" of any items that it particularly valued in life (provided the originals are not in another creature's possession). The equipment works normally for the ghost but passes harmlessly through material objects or creatures. A weapon of +1 or better magical enhancement, however, can harm material creatures, but any such attack deals only half as much damage (50%) unless it is a ghost touch weapon. A ghost can use shields or armor only if they have the ghost touch quality." Mahus explained.

Fluvand looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "The original items remain behind, just as the ghost's physical remains do. If another creature seizes the original, the incorporeal copy fades away. This loss invariably angers the ghost, who stops at nothing to return the item to its original resting place (and thus regain the item's use)."

Fluvand slipped the man 9 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Fluvand.

Fluvand saw a ruinous ghost in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the heinous sight. Fluvand hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter10"></a> Chapter 10: Swichlest and the Air Veela

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Swichlest. The silversmith finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a bowyer. A barker slowly carried supplies. Fluvand continued down the path. The curate threw punches with a halberdier.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a paperer. The man, eying his impressive armor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Tibbon has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Fluvand have come to destroy him!" Fluvand exclaimed.

Nearby, a poulter scuttled out of his way. The man eyed him thoughtfullyHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Fluvand. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Xenous is past the inn. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. The link man gazed at him from an open window with a wood seller. Two pissprophets bit into an apple. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Xenous looked up from his work behind a counter at Fluvand.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Xenous grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of glass golems and hieracosphinxs flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Xenous returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The monster air veela is terrifying for sure, but I honestly don't know much about that beast."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the air veela so bad?" Fluvand responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Fluvand saw a ungodly air veela in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the scary sight. Fluvand hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter11"></a> Chapter 11: Clanchmondenhiria) and the Wight

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Clanchmondenhiria). Two drummers stood by a market stall, negotiating with the glass seller. Nearby, a archer sat by the side of the road. Fluvand continued down the path. Two millers sat by the side of the road.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a hawker. Fluvand approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Tibbon has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Fluvand have come to destroy him!" Fluvand exclaimed.

Nearby, a mailer talked excitedly with what appeared to be a ropemaker. The man quietly reminised about the pastHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Fluvand. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Gerhard Fine Supplies". You'll find Gerhard, the best weapons expert we've got. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. While the plattner bit into an apple, a constable sat by the side of the road. Nearby, a wetnurse ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Estes. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Fluvand cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Gerhard grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of adlets and seraptiss flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Gerhard returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Wights are humanoids who rise as undead due to necromancy, a violent death, or an extremely malevolent personality. In some cases, a wight arises when an evil undead spirit permanently bonds with a corpse, often the corpse of a slain warrior. They are barely recognizable to those who knew them in life; their flesh is twisted by evil and undeath, the eyes burn with hatred, and the teeth become beast-like. In some ways, a wight bridges the gap between a ghoul and a spectre—a warped animated corpse whose touch steals living energy."

Fluvand slipped the man 4 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"As undead, wights do not need to breathe, so they are sometimes found underwater, though they are not particularly good swimmers unless they were originally swimming creatures such as aquatic elves or merfolk. Underwater wights prefer low-ceilinged caves where their limited swimming isn't as much of a liability." Gerhard explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the wight?" Fluvand asked.

"The wight presented here is a typical example of its kind, but sometimes when a wight creates spawn from particularly unusual humanoids, the resulting wights are quite different in power, such as the following three variants." Gerhard explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the wight so bad?" Fluvand responded.

Gerhard returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Brute Wight (CR 5): Giants that are killed by wights become hunchbacked, simple-minded undead. Brute wights are giant advanced wights, but cannot create spawn of their own."

Fluvand slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Cairn Wight (CR 4): Some societies deliberately create these specialized wights to serve as guardians for barrows or other burial sites. A cairn wight is an advanced wight that fights with a weapon, typically a sword, that channels its energy drain attack and affects creatures damaged by the weapon as if they had been struck by the wight's slam attack." Gerhard explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the wight?" Fluvand asked.

Gerhard returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Frost Wight (CR 4): Wights created in cold environments sometimes become pale undead with blue-white eyes and ice in their hair. Frost wights have the cold subtype and their slam attacks deal 1d6 cold damage in addition to the normal effects. A creature touching a frost wight with natural weapons or unarmed strikes takes 1d6 cold damage."

Fluvand looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Fluvand saw a unholy wight in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the mean sight. Fluvand hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter12"></a> Chapter 12: Westow and the Su

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Westow. While the sawyer hawked fine imported goods from Gon, a purse maker slept in an alleyway. While the trapper slept in an alleyway, a basketmaker hawked fine imported goods from Kidam. Fluvand continued down the path. A mailmaker ran from person to person, asking if they had seen VÃ©ziariht.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a tanner. The man, eying his impressive armor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Tibbon took over?" Fluvand asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

While the pattenmaker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a pissprophet, a archer finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Fluvand. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Domederich is down the street to the tavern and right. You'll see a warehouse. It's down the street to the tavern and right. You'll see a tavern. It's past the stables. It's just to the left. Tell him I sent you. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 2 small coins. "I want that Tibbon gone as much as anybody."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a chandler rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Nearby, a hatmaker slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Domederich looked up from his work behind a counter at Fluvand.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Domederich lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The su."

Domederich returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Hateful and melancholic, the psychic marsupials called su can feel their minds weaken as they mature, and take out their frustration on any creatures who enter their forests."

Fluvand looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "All su bear young. After mating, they implant each other's back-pouches with oily, tumor-like eggs which hatch over the next year into tiny, psychically gifted humanoids. These young su cling to their parents' backs, feeding on parasites and scraps. Born at the apex of their psychic abilities, baby su slowly change shape and lose their powers over their first year—by the time they reach their full predatory form, all psychic magic has vanished. These furious new adults then leave to become providers for their own whelps. A grown su is 5 feet long and 90 pounds."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the su?" Fluvand asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Fluvand.

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Domederich was talking about."

## <a name="chapter13"></a> Chapter 13: Pary Lan Parkingh and the Lyrakien

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Pary Lan Parkingh. A pardoner scuttled out of his way. Nearby, a innkeeper scuttled out of his way. Fluvand continued down the path. Two hobblers slowly carried supplies.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a astronomer. The man, eying his dangerous demeanor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Fluvand, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Tibbon." Fluvand announced.

Nearby, a peasant sat by the side of the road. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Fluvand. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Chard is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a seamstress hawked fine imported goods from Cary. Nearby, a seamstress stood by a market stall, negotiating with the knifesmith. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Fluvand cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the rokurokubi, or perhaps even the wererat (human form), but that's nothing compared to the lyrakien we've got."

Chard returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Lyrakien are divine musicians and messengers, mainly in the employ of deities of travel and natural wonders. They love to explore and visit beautiful places, especially locations with excellent views of rainbows, moonlight, and the stars. Whimsical and joyous, they love contests of song, dance, and knowledge, and keep journeys happy by distracting their companions from weary feet and stale food. Mortals who please them with excellent tales and new songs may be rewarded with elaborate maps, forgotten shortcuts, or rambling directions to hidden locations that hold lost magic."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the lyrakien?" Fluvand asked.

Chard returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Lyrakien are light-hearted creatures, but they are very protective of breathtaking natural locations. Often called "glistenwings" by gnomes and halflings, lyrakien are frequently mistaken for fey—while they are generally friendly with true fey, their origin is the plane of Elysium. Like other azatas, they grow restless if they stay in one place too long. A chaotic good 7th-level spellcaster can gain a lyrakien as a familiar if she has the Improved Familiar feat."

## <a name="chapter14"></a> Chapter 14: Ereesterder and the Caller In Darkness

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Ereesterder. A crossbowman rushed by quickly, ignoring him. The ferryman finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a poet. Fluvand continued down the path. While the tentsman bit into an apple, a hurdle maker loaded a market stall with wares.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a executioner. Fluvand approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Tibbon has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Fluvand have come to destroy him!" Fluvand exclaimed.

Nearby, a alewife sat by the side of the road. He still looked suspicious, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Fluvand. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Huggithmir is into the market and towards the church. Eventually you need to walk past the stables. It's just to the left. Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. While the engineer gazed at him from an open window, a roper talked excitedly with what appeared to be a cutler. A emperor scuttled out of his way. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Huggithmir looked up from his work behind a counter at Fluvand.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the astral deva, or perhaps even the warmonger wasp, but that's nothing compared to the caller in darkness we've got."

"A caller in darkness grows from the psychic remains of a creature with psychic sensitivity that died a violent death, its restless spirit compelled to visit upon others the horrors that it suffered before dying. As more and more minds are absorbed, it grows, and the original spirit is lost in the swirling mass of hatred, confusion, and despair." Huggithmir explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the caller in darkness so bad?" Fluvand responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Fluvand saw a detestable caller in darkness in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the frightful sight. Fluvand hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter15"></a> Chapter 15: Champley and the Dagon

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Champley. The stonecarver rushed by quickly, ignoring him with a troubadour. Nearby, a chancellor gazed at him from an open window. Fluvand continued down the path. A mosaic layer rushed by quickly, ignoring him.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a shipchandler. The man, eying his unusual weapons, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Tibbon took over?" Fluvand asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a bellfounder scuttled out of his way. The man eyed him thoughtfullyHe finally responded.

"Our village of Gon will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. You'll find Anke, the best weapons expert we've got. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. A procurator stood by a market stall, negotiating with the ditcher. Two confectioners sat by the side of the road. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Fluvand cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the crucidaemon, or perhaps even the hollow serpent, but that's nothing compared to the dagon we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Dagon is the demon lord of deformity, the sea, and sea monsters. He rules an Abyssal realm that consists of an immense ocean dotted above with strange and horrible islands and marked below with countless deep sea trenches and sunken cities. Dagon is 35 feet long, with the lower body of an eel, a horrific visage that evokes images of deep sea predators, and four long tentacles in place of arms."

Fluvand looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Dagon almost always uses Power Attack in combat, taking a –9 penalty on all attack rolls but gaining a +18 bonus on damage rolls. He is never encountered without a large number of aquatic demons or monsters at his side that he uses as pawns in battles, often simply commanding them to attack foes while he hangs back in the shadows and observes the fight with his cold eyes. Immense sharks, hezrous, carnivorous whales, krakens, and shoggoths are the demon lord's favored minions."

Fluvand looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Anke returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Dagon began life not as a demon lord but as a powerful qlippoth—the reasons for his transformation into a demon lord are not understood by mortal scholars, but there is certainly no love lost between Dagon and the qlippoth race."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the dagon?" Fluvand asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Fluvand.

## <a name="chapter16"></a> Chapter 16: Kend Hullestoneton and the Gearghost

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Kend Hullestoneton. Two potters sat by the side of the road. Two solicitors talked excitedly with what appeared to be a baker. Fluvand continued down the path. While the clockmaker bit into an apple, a bodger sat by the side of the road.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a cutler. The man, eying his dangerous demeanor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Tibbon took over?" Fluvand asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

While the ropemaker slept in an alleyway, a ferryman hawked fine imported goods from Mard. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"Our village of Blostch will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Vides is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. While the clockmaker scuttled out of his way, a plasterer bit into an apple. The clothier talked excitedly with what appeared to be a pewterer with a chaplain. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Vides looked up from his work behind a counter at Fluvand.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Vides grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of siyokoys and tripurasuras flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Vides returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Formed from the unquiet soul of a thief wrenched from life by a wicked trap, a gearghost delights in rigging up the same threats and tortures to which it succumbed. Eager to witness the deaths of others, the gearghost prowls the place of its death, constantly maintaining and resetting any traps in that area as it waits for victims to fall into its clutches. A gearghost also has the ability to create and set new traps, and as such its lair is usually choked with perilous new snares, spikes, and pits. A gearghost only keeps treasure as a lure for hapless adventurers, often using such treasure as the trigger for one of its devious creations."

Fluvand looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Fluvand saw a mean gearghost in the distance! Fluvand readied his sword. Fluvand hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Fluvand lunged toward the gearghost, his sword ready to strike! That blow seemed like it could break some bones. The monster was stunned by the attack. Fluvand lunged toward the gearghost, his sword ready to strike! The slippery gearghost evaded Fluvand's hit.

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Vides was talking about."

## <a name="chapter17"></a> Chapter 17: Worton and the Clockwork Golem

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Worton. Nearby, a ship's captain slowly carried supplies. Two pewterers gazed at him from an open window. Fluvand continued down the path. A cartwright eyed him suspiciously.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a cowherd. Fluvand approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Tibbon took over?" Fluvand asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

While the carter bit into an apple, a pattenmaker scuttled out of his way. He still looked suspiciousHe finally responded.

"Our village of Lanort will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Dard Fine Supplies". You'll find Dard, the best weapons expert we've got. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. The apothecary hawked fine imported goods from Ball with a architect. The herald threw punches with a taverner. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Dard looked up from his work behind a counter at Fluvand.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Dard lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The clockwork golem."

Dard returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The monster clockwork golem is terrifying for sure, but I honestly don't know much about that beast."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the clockwork golem so bad?" Fluvand responded.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

## <a name="chapter18"></a> Chapter 18: Bannaddington upe and the Ice Yai

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Bannaddington upe. A cardmaker slowly carried supplies. Nearby, a mirrorer scuttled out of his way. Fluvand continued down the path. The costermonger scuttled out of his way with a troubadour.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a mariner. The man, eying his foreboding cloak, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Tibbon took over?" Fluvand asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

While the plumber rushed by quickly, ignoring him, a beguine eyed him suspiciously. He still looked suspiciousHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Fluvand. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Evanestremfrid is past the warehouse. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 6 small coins. "I want that Tibbon gone as much as anybody."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a shepherd rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Nearby, a mathematician talked excitedly with what appeared to be a fuller. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Fluvand cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Evanestremfrid lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The ice yai."

Evanestremfrid returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The ice yai is a sinister creature that combines the brutality of a frost giant with the grace and style of a skilled martial artist. Although its magical powers are formidable, it prefers to fight in melee using its slam attacks, leading its minions in merciless combat. It uses its mobility to cast combat spells or launch shards of ice from its third eye."

Fluvand slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"An ice yai is a natural leader among frost giants, tempering their savagery with its own wisdom. A tribe led by an ice yai may still raid settlements of neighboring humanoids, but the tribe soon learns the value of establishing regular tributes and willing sacrifices—the ice yai teach that methods that rely upon the threat of violence are often even more effective than actual violence. Despite this strangely enlightened philosophy, an ice yai never passes up an opportunity to reinforce its capacity for slaughter, and will often demand that its subjects take part in show battles, both for the entertainment of the tribe and to nurture the ice yai's insatiable ego and sense of dominion over its subjects." Evanestremfrid explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the ice yai?" Fluvand asked.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Evanestremfrid was talking about."

## <a name="chapter19"></a> Chapter 19: Cralestley & Itherburn and the Formian Myrmarch

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Cralestley & Itherburn. While the footpad talked excitedly with what appeared to be a salter, a restaurateur slowly carried supplies. A dean eyed him suspiciously. Fluvand continued down the path. The spy threw punches with a goldsmith.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a pavyler. The man, eying his determined look, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Fluvand, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Tibbon." Fluvand announced.

The butler sat by the side of the road with a halberdier. The man quietly reminised about the past, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Osgillown will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Elepos is into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the monastery and right. You'll see a tavern. It's just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. Tell him I sent you. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 5 small coins. "I want that Tibbon gone as much as anybody."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. While the tillerman talked excitedly with what appeared to be a constable, a fisherman bit into an apple. Two palmers sat by the side of the road. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Elepos looked up from his work behind a counter at Fluvand.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Elepos grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of adherers and calignis flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

Elepos returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Myrmarchs are an elite caste of the formian race. They serve as direct agents for the queen, acting as advisors and generals, or administrating tasks where complexity or propriety renders taskmasters unsuitable. It is myrmarchs who answer the call when a particularly skilled diplomat or emissary is required to carry the queen's words outside of the territory of the hive to the dangerously disorganized races."

Fluvand slipped the man 9 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"While myrmarchs make up the aristocracy of formian society, this does not make them pampered intellectuals and bureaucrats. On the contrary, they are even more deadly than the warriors they often command, and do not hesitate to use their considerable might to aid and protect their kin. Myrmarchs facing combat apply their natural poison to their javelins, making them even more lethal." Elepos explained.

Fluvand looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Like other formians, myrmarchs record their life's history upon their carapaces. Between their greater opportunities and longer lifespans (roughly as long as those of humans), myrmarchs can cover nearly every inch of their shells with great deeds accomplished, foes overcome, and service to the hive. Some myrmarchs actually run out of space for new records: some die shortly thereafter, knowing that they have served their queen to the utmost, while others add new artificial plates to their carapaces to continue their epics." Elepos explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the formian myrmarch so bad?" Fluvand responded.

"The most accomplished, trusted, and battle-tested of their race, myrmarchs form the queen's elite bodyguard. In a small hive, these bodyguards likely have the same statistics presented above. In the oldest and largest hives, however, most possess class levels." Elepos explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the formian myrmarch?" Fluvand asked.

Elepos returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A myrmarch has an enlarged thorax and abdomen, which give it the same general size and weight as a large warhorse, though its upper body is not much larger than that of a formian warrior's. Myrmarchs stand about 8 feet high and weigh about 1,200 pounds."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the formian myrmarch?" Fluvand asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Fluvand.

Fluvand says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Elepos was talking about."

## <a name="chapter20"></a> Chapter 20: Brisle and the Locathah

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Brisle. Nearby, a mummer finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The horseleech talked excitedly with what appeared to be a vintner with a chainmaker. Fluvand continued down the path. A woolman gazed at him from an open window.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a lady. Fluvand approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Tibbon has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Fluvand have come to destroy him!" Fluvand exclaimed.

The scholar loaded a market stall with wares with a sergeant. The man sat in silence for a whileHe finally responded.

"Our village of Can will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is into the market and towards the stables. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the stables. Eventually you need to walk past the monastery. It's just to the left. You'll find Raynaeus, the best weapons expert we've got. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. Two housewifes bit into an apple. Nearby, a woodcutter slept in an alleyway. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Raynaeus looked up from his work behind a counter at Fluvand.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Raynaeus grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of ecorches and warsworns flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"Simple aquatic creatures shunned by landwalkers and undersea folk alike, locathahs live in tight-knit communities scattered throughout the world's seas, lakes. and waterways. Locathahs possess scaly ochre skin tinged with green and yellow. Ridged, rust-colored skin covers their chests and stomachs, and a mottled wash of green, brown, and orange colors their fins like aging kelp. Locathahs exude a strong fishy odor when above water that, in addition to their already unnerving appearance, repulses most land-dwellers. Despite this animosity, locathahs go to great lengths to befriend surface folk, offering safe passage through the waters, pointing out dangerous reefs, and hinting at sunken treasures in return for durable ceramics and metal tools and weapons, as well as tubers, which they view as a delicacy." Raynaeus explained.

Fluvand slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"These creatures dislike combat and flee when disarmed or outnumbered. Locathahs hold community in the highest regard, never leaving a friend behind and often going to great lengths to retrieve a fallen companion. Among their own kind and races friendly toward them, locathahs are social creatures who live a very human-like, albeit simple, lifestyle. Locathahs work in stone, coral, and bone to produce the crude implements they use. Some take coral work to obsessive levels, with certain clans taking generations to grow their preferred medium in its desired form before carving it. They feed on crustaceans, undersea plants, and shellfish, and rarely on large fish that are caught during ritualized hunts." Raynaeus explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the locathah so bad?" Fluvand responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Locathah matriarchs serve their undersea tribes not only as chieftains, but also as the primary egg layers of the community. Each adult member of the tribe is responsible for raising a single young locathah as his or her own. Locathahs tame moray eels, keeping them near their lairs as humans keep dogs. Some locathah soldiers and hunting groups use giant moray eels as mounts, chasing down their quarry and attacking with narrow-tipped spears. More powerful aquatic races use locathahs as slaves, abducting breeding matriarchs to produce a constant wave of new workers."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the locathah so bad?" Fluvand responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Locathah stand roughly as tall as humans, yet their fins jut out, giving them an imposing stature. Lean and strong, locathahs weigh roughly 160 pounds."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the locathah?" Fluvand asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Fluvand.

Fluvand saw a awful locathah in the distance! The inflated Fluvand readied his sword. Fluvand hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Fluvand lunged toward the locathah, his sword ready to strike! A sharp crack was heard as the strike left its mark. The locathah struck with its longspear! Fluvand jumps out of the way. Fluvand lunged toward the locathah, his sword ready to strike! The slippery locathah evaded Fluvand's hit. 

The locathah struck with its longspear! Fluvand reeled back in pain. Fluvand leaned on his sword to catch a moment's respite. Fluvand the nobleour hero was worn out by the combat. The locathah leans low, ready to strike with its might.

The adventurer was victorious! The locathah menaced for no longer! 

## <a name="chapter21"></a> Chapter 21: Manochesforton and the Animate Dream

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Manochesforton. While the smelter threw punches, a bailiff threw punches. While the cheesemaker finished an apple and tossed the core aside, a cobbler sat by the side of the road. Fluvand continued down the path. Nearby, a banker gazed at him from an open window.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a currier. Fluvand approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Fluvand, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Tibbon." Fluvand announced.

Two mosaic layers loaded a market stall with wares. He still looked suspiciousHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Fluvand. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Thyrice is into the market and towards the stables. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a gardner hawked fine imported goods from Cocheter Hillow. A jew sat by the side of the road. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Thyrice looked up from his work behind a counter at Fluvand.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the arsinoitherium, or perhaps even the dire corby, but that's nothing compared to the animate dream we've got."

Thyrice returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "From time to time, when a powerfully imaginative sleeper wakes from a particularly vivid or unusual dream, a fragment of that dream lingers on the Ethereal Plane. To survive, this animate dream needs the power of living will, imagination, and emotion to sustain it. An animate dream seeks out mortal minds, appearing as a shadowy and often frightful dream figure. Its true appearance is vague and nebulous, but it reacts to the fears and emotions of those around it, taking on a nightmarish appearance that differs for each viewer."

Fluvand slipped the man 5 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Thyrice returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "An animate dream can find satisfaction and sustenance by passing one of its ghostly limbs through a mortal's body—the act infusing the mortal with negative energy that sates the animate dream's unnatural hunger. But by forcing a creature into a state of sleep, terror, or both, the animate dream can gain a much more satisfying meal, feeding on the emotions released in such states. It uses its spell-like abilities to this end, for each creature it harms with its nightmares, drives temporarily insane with confusion or fear, or outright slays with phantasmal killer provides the monster with more nourishment. An animate dream forced to go for a long period of time without feeding does not starve to death, but does grow increasingly feral and violent in nature."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the animate dream?" Fluvand asked.

"Animate dreams sometimes associate with other creatures from the Ethereal Plane or that have associations with dreams and nightmares, such as night hags, phase spiders, and xills. Sometimes these alliances are mutually beneficial, but in many cases the animate dreams are treated as slaves. Night hags in particular like enslaving animate dreams, and sometimes use their essence as a component in creating heartstones." Thyrice explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the animate dream so bad?" Fluvand responded.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Fluvand.

Fluvand saw a lousy animate dream in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the heinous sight. Fluvand hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter22"></a> Chapter 22: Bay and the Chuspiki

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Bay. A gunsmith gazed at him from an open window. While the thimbler scuttled out of his way, a armorer bit into an apple. Fluvand continued down the path. Two wood sellers eyed him suspiciously.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a rugmaker. Fluvand approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Tibbon took over?" Fluvand asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Two pikemans talked excitedly with what appeared to be a clockmaker. The man sat in silence for a whileHe finally responded.

"Our village of Mangdon will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Demosoniaumela is down the street to the stables and right. You'll see a cattle barn. It's down the street to the tavern and right. You'll see a barn. It's down the street to the tavern and left. You'll see a tavern. It's into the market and towards the inn. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Demosoniaumela Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a drycooper slowly carried supplies. While the molecatcher loaded a market stall with wares, a siege engineer gazed at him from an open window. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Demosoniaumela looked up from his work behind a counter at Fluvand.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the spirit naga, or perhaps even the crone queen, but that's nothing compared to the chuspiki we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Chuspikis are intelligent, mouselike creatures covered in a coat of downy tan fur which makes them appear much larger than they actually are. A chuspiki's tail is substantially longer than the rest of its body, fanning out into a sail-like structure. The base of its tail is strong and flexible, allowing the chuspiki to whip around the fan at the tip with surprising speed. It can use this motion to create concussive blasts of air, or to scratch opponents with barbs on the underside of its tail bones."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the chuspiki so bad?" Fluvand responded.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Like the wind itself, chuspikis are always moving. Chuspikis soar through the air, riding their fans like gliders and summoning minor gusts to steer their flight. They rest in short bursts, napping for just an hour at a time."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the chuspiki?" Fluvand asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Whenever they can, chuspikis seek out new experiences. They are social creatures that prefer to travel with others of their kind, or with members of other species. Chuspikis feel an especially strong connection with other creatures who share their bond with the skies, such as air elementals and sylphs. Chuspikis enjoy exploring unique locations, and when they find a particularly fascinating site, they announce their find on the winds to encourage others to share in their discovery. A mysterious disembodied voice promising glorious adventure may very well be a chuspiki; however, the playful creatures are just as likely to play pranks on hapless passersby as they are to provide legitimate guidance."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the chuspiki?" Fluvand asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "A typical chuspiki is 1 foot long, with its tail extending out an additional 5 feet, and weighs 1 pound. Its bones are hollow, like a bird's."

Fluvand looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"A chuspiki will sometimes ally with a spellcaster as a familiar. A chaotic spellcaster can gain a chuspiki as a familiar at 7th level by taking the Improved Familiar feat." Demosoniaumela explained.

Fluvand looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Fluvand.

Fluvand saw a horrid chuspiki in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the sickie sight. Fluvand hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter23"></a> Chapter 23: Rayswickpon-Treet Finswarry Havon up and the Living Wall

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Rayswickpon-Treet Finswarry Havon up. Two shoemakers talked excitedly with what appeared to be a tillerman. A farrier stood by a market stall, negotiating with the spectaclesmaker. Fluvand continued down the path. A rivener slowly carried supplies.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a cooper. Fluvand approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Tibbon took over?" Fluvand asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a bagger rushed by quickly, ignoring him. He still looked suspicious, then finally responded.

"Our village of Sholl Treephey will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is down the street to the monastery and left. You'll see a inn. It's down the street to the tavern and left. You'll see a barn. It's down the street to the cattle barn and right. You'll see a tavern. It's past the barn. It's just to the right. You'll find Fastus, the best weapons expert we've got. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 10 small coins. "I want that Tibbon gone as much as anybody."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. Two gravediggers slowly carried supplies. Two princes slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Fastus looked up from his work behind a counter at Fluvand.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the ghaele, or perhaps even the nightwalker, but that's nothing compared to the living wall we've got."

"A living wall is a construct built out of the bodies of many creatures and mortared together with liquefied flesh. Like a gelatinous cube, it fills an entire 10-foot square, allowing it to completely block a hallway. Several living walls placed next to one another can obstruct an entire room. Its normal method of attack is to creep into range to make slam attacks, then push opponents against other walls and crush them to death. Living walls follow basic orders and are normally used to block access to certain parts of their creator's lair—to get through a living wall, it must be killed and hacked apart to create a space other creatures can pass through. Living walls can be ordered to stack themselves on top of each other to reach higher ceilings, but this requires a ramp to allow one to climb onto the other." Fastus explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the living wall?" Fluvand asked.

"A living wall rises 8 to 10 feet high and weighs 4,000 pounds. The appearance of each one varies wildly depending on the creatures used to make up its constituent parts." Fastus explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the living wall?" Fluvand asked.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

## <a name="chapter24"></a> Chapter 24: Road and the Fastachee

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Road. While the shipchandler threw punches, a beerbrewer scuttled out of his way. Two tentsmans eyed him suspiciously. Fluvand continued down the path. While the curate stood by a market stall, negotiating with the jailer, a plowman scuttled out of his way.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a pewterer. Fluvand approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Fluvand, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Tibbon." Fluvand announced.

Two horners finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The man sat in silence for a whileHe finally responded.

"Our village of Dol Gal will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Hildebrianulf is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the inn. Eventually you need to walk past the cattle barn. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Hildebrianulf Fine Supplies". I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. Two almoners slowly carried supplies. A fool for money slept in an alleyway. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Hildebrianulf looked up from his work behind a counter at Fluvand.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the giant muckdweller, or perhaps even the cursed king, but that's nothing compared to the fastachee we've got."

Hildebrianulf returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Fastachees are mysterious, wise, and generous fey who foster the growth of nearby plants. Many communities who interact with them revere them as bringers of food and medicine, as well as protectors of crops. These fey have a particularly strong connection to corn; they regularly project their senses through corn plants to monitor the health of the field and search the local area for threats. They prefer to avoid direct confrontation if possible, using their ability to originate their spells from corn plants to harass those they wish to chase away."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the fastachee so bad?" Fluvand responded.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

## <a name="chapter25"></a> Chapter 25: Onde Stree and the Ice Troll

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Onde Stree. While the clockmaker talked excitedly with what appeared to be a palmer, a dwarf ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Bades. Nearby, a furrier hawked fine imported goods from Hare. Fluvand continued down the path. A fool loaded a market stall with wares.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a balancemaker. Fluvand approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Fluvand, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Tibbon." Fluvand announced.

A nakerer finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The man quietly reminised about the pastHe finally responded.

"Our village of Parrow Tunnostoft will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is into the market and towards the inn. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the barn and right. You'll see a stables. It's into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk past the inn. It's just to the left. You'll find Bizi, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. The carver threw punches with a jailer. Two fishmongers finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Bizi looked up from his work behind a counter at Fluvand.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Bizi lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The ice troll."

"Ice trolls are somewhat smaller than normal trolls, but they possess greater intelligence and cunning and are just as voraciously hungry. They display the typical hunched posture of trolls, combined with long arms tipped with sharp claws and the distinctive troll underbite. Like normal trolls, ice trolls possess amazing regenerative powers that enable them to recover from almost any wound. Unlike most trolls, ice trolls often use weapons in battle, but in the heat of combat, they often cast aside weapons in favor of their rending claws. An ice troll stands about 10 feet tall and weighs up to 900 pounds." Bizi explained.

Fluvand looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Because of their greater intellects, ice trolls sometimes work as mercenaries, and often serve as soldiers in monstrous armies. They frequently ally with frost giants, and may even be found among northern barbarian tribes, as long as they are well fed and well paid." Bizi explained.

Fluvand slipped the man 5 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Bizi returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Ice trolls enjoy the taste of human flesh, and those not working with humans frequently set traps near civilized areas to catch their favorite prey. They will also raid isolated settlements for food, often bringing captured humans back to their icy lairs, where the unfortunate victims are caged and fattened up before finally being devoured by the voracious trolls."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the ice troll?" Fluvand asked.

Bizi returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "In combat, ice trolls are more cautious than normal trolls. They do not normally rush headlong into battle, instead focusing on weaker foes or those bearing fire. They do not hesitate to attack opponents armed with fire, but work together to defeat such enemies before they can bring their dangerous weapons to bear."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the ice troll so bad?" Fluvand responded.

Bizi returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Ice troll society is more patriarchal than normal troll society, and while males may form gangs to hunt or raid, most ice trolls live in small family groups comprised of a male, a female, and their offspring."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the ice troll so bad?" Fluvand responded.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Fluvand.

Fluvand saw a unholy ice troll in the distance! Fluvand readied his sword. Fluvand hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The adventurer was victorious! The ice troll menaced for no longer! 

## <a name="chapter26"></a> Chapter 26: Fark and the Elephant

Fluvand followed a dirt path into the village of Fark. Nearby, a waferer talked excitedly with what appeared to be a maid. The taverner scuttled out of his way with a lorimer. Fluvand continued down the path. Two basinbeaters ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Halef.

Eventually, Fluvand arrived at the town square, where he found a fuller. The man, eying his strong forearms, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Tibbon has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Fluvand have come to destroy him!" Fluvand exclaimed.

While the rat catcher threw punches, a pickpocket talked excitedly with what appeared to be a sexton. The man quietly reminised about the pastHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Fluvand. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Balin is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Balin Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Fluvand hurried towards the armory. A mercer finished an apple and tossed the core aside. A parker gazed at him from an open window. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Balin looked up from his work behind a counter at Fluvand.

"I'm Fluvand, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Tibbon. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the minotaur, or perhaps even the stringy demodand, but that's nothing compared to the elephant we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "These large land animals, majestically wandering the plains in tightly knit family herds, are symbols of wisdom and strength. Having few natural predators, elephants are sometimes hunted for their ivory tusks. These tusks often become jewelry, statuettes, and trinkets for the wealthy. "

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the elephant so bad?" Fluvand responded.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.
