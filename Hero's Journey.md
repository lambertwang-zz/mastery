## <a name="chapter1"></a> Chapter 1: Suthordelfort and the Dybbuk

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Suthordelfort. Nearby, a cowherd gazed at him from an open window. While the curate gazed at him from an open window, a pikeman gazed at him from an open window. Zamos continued down the path. While the parish priest sat by the side of the road, a spearman rushed by quickly, ignoring him.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a hurdle maker. Zamos approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Zamos, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Audo." Zamos announced.

Two rakers eyed him suspiciously. The man quietly reminised about the past, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Zamos. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. You'll find Aspuanippus, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. The hay merchant finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a maid. Two bargemans threw punches. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Aspuanippus looked up from his work behind a counter at Zamos.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Aspuanippus grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of erlkings and sylphs flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "A dybbuk is a misplaced soul who has eluded judgment because of a some great transgression or a pitiful suicide. Like a ghost, it lingers on in the mortal world, either trying to fulfill an insane need to right some great failure that has marked its soul for eternity or merely to spread the torment it is condemned to face for eternity. Bodiless and left to wander, dybbuks grow increasingly bitter and resentful over the loss of their bodies and endlessly seek mortal or even inanimate forms to steal and use to sow suffering. Vile manipulators, they seek bodies that have the greatest potential to cause pain in those closest to their victims, taking pleasure in shifting a leader's agenda toward the destruction of her followers or torturing an innocent from within. Dybbuks also often animate unliving things to spread fear, reveling in the chaos resulting from manipulating corpses to confuse and terrify. Most also realize they have all of eternity to torment their chosen victims, and might lurk quietly near a living target for weeks or months, waiting for the right moment to act and begin their terrors anew."

Zamos slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Zamos.

Zamos says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Aspuanippus was talking about."

## <a name="chapter2"></a> Chapter 2: Harlow Ter Hary and the Pachycephalosaurus

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Harlow Ter Hary. While the swordsmith loaded a market stall with wares, a stillroom maid stood by a market stall, negotiating with the pikeman. Nearby, a pursuivant ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Alkmain. Zamos continued down the path. The shingler bit into an apple with a lorimer.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a potboy. The man, eying his dangerous demeanor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Audo took over?" Zamos asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

While the sailor stood by a market stall, negotiating with the rat catcher, a tanner scuttled out of his way. The man eyed him thoughtfully, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Zamos. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is past the tavern. There's a small door. You'll find Gidius, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. Two clothiers rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Two fruitiers bit into an apple. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Zamos cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Gidius lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The pachycephalosaurus."

Gidius returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A pachycephalosaurus is a normally peaceful dinosaur that grows irate and violent during mating season or when its herd is intruded upon by potential predators. The dinosaur's skull has a distinctive dome-shaped crown surrounded by numerous bony horns—this, combined with the dinosaur's powerful, compact neck, allows it to make battering-ram-like charges capable of inflicting great damage."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the pachycephalosaurus?" Zamos asked.

Gidius returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Pachycephalosauruses grow to a length of 15 feet and weigh 1,400 pounds. "

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the pachycephalosaurus?" Zamos asked.

"That's all I can tell you."

Zamos saw a detestable pachycephalosaurus in the distance! He readied his sword. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter3"></a> Chapter 3: Minge and the Poison Frog

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Minge. While the dog trainer slowly carried supplies, a bailiff threw punches. While the roofer finished an apple and tossed the core aside, a furniture maker slept in an alleyway. Zamos continued down the path. While the sheepshearer loaded a market stall with wares, a carman gazed at him from an open window.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a executioner. Zamos approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Audo has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Zamos have come to destroy him!" Zamos exclaimed.

A minnesinger ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Ance. The man eyed him thoughtfully, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Sters will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Nigs is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. While the begger threw punches, a hayward sat by the side of the road. Two porters eyed him suspiciously. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Nigs looked up from his work behind a counter at Zamos.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Nigs lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The poison frog."

Nigs returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Poisonous frogs are a bright green color, with additional bright yellow, red, or blue markings. They are just over a foot long and weigh 10 pounds. The poison of poisonous frogs is often gathered by primitive tribes and used to coat darts and arrows for hunting."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the poison frog?" Zamos asked.

Nigs returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "You can make a larger poison frog either by applying the giant simple template or by giving a normal giant frog a poison frog's venomous bite."

Zamos slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Zamos.

## <a name="chapter4"></a> Chapter 4: Bantral and the Vouivre

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Bantral. While the surgeon finished an apple and tossed the core aside, a clerk talked excitedly with what appeared to be a pilot. The merchant taylor gazed at him from an open window with a feltmaker. Zamos continued down the path. Nearby, a gardner bit into an apple.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a hurdle maker. The man, eying his impressive armor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Audo took over?" Zamos asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a brazier talked excitedly with what appeared to be a oilmaker. The man quietly reminised about the past, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Zamos. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Gefroi is into the market and towards the monastery. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the stables. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the church and left. You'll see a church. It's just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a mercer loaded a market stall with wares. While the pilot talked excitedly with what appeared to be a player, a chapman slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Gefroi looked up from his work behind a counter at Zamos.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Gefroi lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The vouivre."

Gefroi returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A vouivre is a deceptive and monstrous predator that looks like a humanoid woman from the waist up and the front end of a green-scaled dragon from the waist down. It shuns the company of its own kind, preferring evil fey (particularly water-dwelling ones such as nixies) for intelligent conversation and mundane snakes for companionship. A vouivre is 12 feet long from head to head, weighs 500 pounds, and can live 200 years."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the vouivre so bad?" Zamos responded.

"Vouivres make their homes in small caves near calm waters. They like to decorate their lairs with shiny coins, jewelry, and bright silks. One might place some of its treasure in the water outside to lure in curious humanoids, and bathe in these waters as a further enticement, hiding its reptilian half until prey is within striking distance. Because a vouivre can breathe water or air (from either head), it often grabs a creature, then retreats underwater to wait for the opponent to drown. It prefers humanoid flesh, but will feed on any available warm-blooded prey. Vouivres have an affinity for music, and their magic is often accompanied by singing or subtle musical vibrations from their scales." Gefroi explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the vouivre so bad?" Zamos responded.

Gefroi returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "When a vouivre dies, its dragon head disgorges a 2-foot-diameter glassy egg. After around 6 weeks, the egg hatches into one or two vouivres, which take 7 years to reach maturity. These offspring resemble humanoids the mother has eaten, so it prefers to feast on attractive and strong victims. The young also adapt to the appearance of nearby reptilian creatures."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the vouivre?" Zamos asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Zamos.

## <a name="chapter5"></a> Chapter 5: Soust Hills Park and the Wyrmwraith

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Soust Hills Park. Two sherrifs rushed by quickly, ignoring him. While the stonecutter slept in an alleyway, a dwarf slept in an alleyway. Zamos continued down the path. The embroiderer slept in an alleyway with a skinner.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a lorimer. Zamos approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Audo took over?" Zamos asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

The ostler stood by a market stall, negotiating with the blockcutter with a barber. He still looked suspicious, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Zamos. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Soke is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 10 small coins. "I want that Audo gone as much as anybody."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. While the prince hawked fine imported goods from Sourn, a tailor slowly carried supplies. The alewife finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a turner. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Zamos cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the vemerak, or perhaps even the celedon, but that's nothing compared to the wyrmwraith we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Wyrmwraiths arise from the souls of powerful dragons who refuse to accept death or have an irrational fear of moving on to an afterlife. No longer concerned with amassing wealth and power, wyrmwraiths instead brood with an unrelenting hatred of all living things. They hate other dragons above all else, seeing the existence of those living creatures as a mockery of their own."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the wyrmwraith?" Zamos asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Wyrmwraiths typically haunt their former lairs or some other location where they can hide from the sunlight. They are drawn toward ancient ruins, forgotten catacombs, and other places associated with death. Litter, detritus and bones lie heaped in areas controlled by a wyrmwraith instead of the coins and gems. In the rare instances when a wyrmwraith is away from its den, the malice of its presence still lingers palpably in the cold air. Still displaying the draconic instinct to protect their homes from would-be thieves, wyrmwraiths will often create and leave behind undead guardians."

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Wyrmwraiths slay those who venture near their lairs, surrounding themselves with their newly created dread wraiths and any other undead they can create or control, carving out small fiefdoms populated by undead servitors. They send their minions to collect anything and anyone with knowledge or power they believe can aid them in their dark endeavors. Captured individuals who please the wyrmwraith can expect to be reborn as powerful undead while those that fail wallow in eternal torment as dread wraiths." Soke explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the wyrmwraith so bad?" Zamos responded.

"On rare occasions throughout history, powerful necromancers or dark cults have managed to entice or coerce a wyrmwraith into an alliance. These collaborations are fleeting, as wyrmwraiths still retain a twisted shadow of their draconic pride, seeing all other creatures as beneath them. Unless compelled to work with others, a wyrmwraith turns on its allies once they are no longer useful to it." Soke explained.

Zamos slipped the man 7 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Finding a way to gain a wyrmwraith's attention is difficult because it is no longer interested in wealth or other mundane material possessions. Instead, wyrmwraiths seek knowledge or items to reverse or improve their undead condition. Their own loathing of what they have become is the only thing as strong as their hatred of the living. Yet, despite their predicament, they still fear ultimate death." Soke explained.

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "A wyrmwraith blights the land with its very presence, a slowly spreading stain tainting anything it touches. Undead activity inevitably increases in any area a wyrmwraith inhabits. Unless a wyrmwraith is destroyed, its territory often becomes a lifeless wasteland for miles."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the wyrmwraith?" Zamos asked.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Wyrmwraiths are very dangerous opponents in combat. They prefer to soften up enemies with their breath weapon and spells before closing in for melee. Wyrmwraiths target clerics, paladins, and other spellcasters wielding divine magic, both because they know divine magic possesses the greatest threat to them and because they see it as a chance to strike back against the gods for their accursed state. Wyrmwraiths care little about how many of their undead minions are destroyed in combat. They are merely pawns to the wyrmwraiths, who have the means at their disposal to create more."

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Soke returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Wyrmwraiths appear as skeletal, ghostly versions of their former selves, their features warped by malice. No matter the size they once possessed, wyrmwraiths measure roughly 50 ft. from snout to tail. Unencumbered by flesh, they move with a silent, effortless, and deadly grace. Even wyrmwraiths' minds become changed in undeath. Already long-lived creatures when they were dragons, some wyrmwraiths have spent an even longer time as undead. Brooding and nurturing brutal hatred for the living for so long drives these wyrmwraiths insane, causing them to become reckless—or self-destructive—and to venture out into the night to rain down destruction on a nearby settlement or even an entire kingdom, knowing that they will eventually be hunted down and destroyed."

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"That's all I can tell you."

Zamos saw a detestable wyrmwraith in the distance! The bold Zamos readied his sword. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter6"></a> Chapter 6: Barner Road and the Nosferatu

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Barner Road. The hayward gazed at him from an open window with a embroiderer. While the bellmaker gazed at him from an open window, a housewife eyed him suspiciously. Zamos continued down the path. Two weepers hawked fine imported goods from Gol.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a forester. Zamos approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Audo has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Zamos have come to destroy him!" Zamos exclaimed.

While the halberdier slowly carried supplies, a sapper rushed by quickly, ignoring him. The man eyed him thoughtfullyHe finally responded.

"Our village of Chead will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Raherthalerte is into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the church. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the stables. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. While the glover slowly carried supplies, a clerk bit into an apple. While the tutor sat by the side of the road, a beer seller talked excitedly with what appeared to be a ostler. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Zamos cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the spinosaurus, or perhaps even the leaf leshy, but that's nothing compared to the nosferatu we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Nosferatu are savage undead who may be the progenitors of the common, more refined vampires. The curse of the nosferatu lacks the elegance and romance of its modern form, harkening to a forgotten age of verminous hunger and eerie powers. Granted immortal life but not immortal youth, nosferatu are withered, embittered creatures unable to create others of their kind, as they somehow lost that ability long ago."

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Their ancient sensibilities still reflect the cruelty of epochs past, and their age-spanning plots are untethered by the modern affliction of morality. Nosferatu resent common vampires (which they call "moroi," an ancient term from a lost language) for their beauty, whereas those vampires scorn the nosferatu as bestial relics of an earlier age, best hidden away in remote ruins so as not to sully the charismatic reputation of "true" vampires."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the nosferatu?" Zamos asked.

Raherthalerte returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Because nosferatu can't create spawn, any nosferatu in existence are very old—created long ago in a time before they lost the ability to infect others with their undead curse. Most nosferatu live in isolated places with few visitors, and a nosferatu could be a thousand years old and yet have fewer than a dozen character levels because it lacks sufficient foes to challenge it or the initiative to train itself."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the nosferatu so bad?" Zamos responded.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Zamos.

Zamos saw a disagreeable nosferatu in the distance! He readied his sword. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

Zamos says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Raherthalerte was talking about."

## <a name="chapter7"></a> Chapter 7: Will and the Mastodon

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Will. The crofter ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Dudouyn with a pioneer. A writer stood by a market stall, negotiating with the bearleader. Zamos continued down the path. While the poet eyed him suspiciously, a almoner stood by a market stall, negotiating with the falconer.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a mathematician. The man, eying his dangerous demeanor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Audo has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Zamos have come to destroy him!" Zamos exclaimed.

Two tinsmiths loaded a market stall with wares. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Zamos. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. You'll find Criscus, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. A fuller ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Abis. While the sergeant-at-arms ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Diagur, a cardinal ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Cunimus. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Criscus looked up from his work behind a counter at Zamos.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the pixie, or perhaps even the vargouille, but that's nothing compared to the mastodon we've got."

Criscus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The great mastodons are primeval cousins of elephants. Their large tusks dwarf those of regular elephants, jutting outward and then curving back toward one another at the tips. Shaggy woolly mammoths are a mastodon variant adapted to cold environments, but have the same statistics."

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Zamos.

## <a name="chapter8"></a> Chapter 8: Ham and the Horn Caterpillar

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Ham. A mosaic layer threw punches. While the smith threw punches, a plattner ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Totaga. Zamos continued down the path. Two grooms scuttled out of his way.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a spinster. Zamos approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Audo has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Zamos have come to destroy him!" Zamos exclaimed.

The old-clothes dealer hawked fine imported goods from Streen Bring with a franklin. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"Our village of Tyneren will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is past the tavern. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Amisko Fine Supplies". You'll find Amisko, the best weapons expert we've got. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. While the abbess eyed him suspiciously, a printer finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Two silversmiths loaded a market stall with wares. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Amisko looked up from his work behind a counter at Zamos.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the cyclops, or perhaps even the hydra, but that's nothing compared to the horn caterpillar we've got."

"Unlike normal caterpillars, voracious giant horn caterpillars don't pupate into butterflies. Instead, they remain in their worm-like forms for their entire life cycle, growing between each molt until they eventually reach the size of large dogs." Amisko explained.

Zamos slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Horn caterpillars feed on the hooves and horns of dead ungulates, which they usually scavenge from corpses. Their sharp mandibles allow them to effortlessly shear through tendon and bone." Amisko explained.

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"That's all I can tell you."

Zamos saw a abominable horn caterpillar in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the terrible sight. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

Zamos says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Amisko was talking about."

## <a name="chapter9"></a> Chapter 9: Burt and the Green Hag

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Burt. The nun scuttled out of his way with a bailiff. The navigator slept in an alleyway with a stonecutter. Zamos continued down the path. Two jailers slept in an alleyway.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a theologian. Zamos approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Audo took over?" Zamos asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a apothecary eyed him suspiciously. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Zamos. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Huoulorril is just a bit further down the street. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Huoulorril Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 3 small coins. "I want that Audo gone as much as anybody."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. A broderer talked excitedly with what appeared to be a goldsmith. While the maid slowly carried supplies, a harness maker bit into an apple. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Zamos cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Huoulorril lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The green hag."

"Terrifying crones known to haunt foul swamps and tangled forests, green hags harbor an intense hatred for all beauty and purity. Making use of their varied deceptive abilities, these crones delight in murdering innocents, unhinging noble minds, and debasing the pure of heart. They are particularly fond of using disguise self to assume the forms of alluring young maidens and then seducing young men away from their lovers or families. In this form, they can infect such noble and upstanding citizens with all manner of debauchery and scandal. Some green hags prefer to reveal their true natures to their lovers at a moment precisely engineered to drive the man mad with horror and shame. Others drag out their dalliances and do what they can to utterly ruin the lives of the men they seduce before showing the broken shell that remains the truth. In the end, the luckiest of these unfortunate lovers end up being eaten by their green hag companions—for the unlucky, their final doom can be much worse, for the cruel imagination of the green hag is vast. " Huoulorril explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the green hag so bad?" Zamos responded.

"A typical green hag stands between 5 and 6 feet tall and weighs just under 160 pounds." Huoulorril explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the green hag so bad?" Zamos responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Zamos saw a repellent green hag in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the revolting sight. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

Zamos says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Huoulorril was talking about."

## <a name="chapter10"></a> Chapter 10: Archmoo and the Thought Eater

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Archmoo. The costermonger talked excitedly with what appeared to be a bricklayer with a harberdasher. A waterman scuttled out of his way. Zamos continued down the path. While the hobbler stood by a market stall, negotiating with the glass seller, a sawyer talked excitedly with what appeared to be a ostler.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a bleacher. Zamos approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Audo took over?" Zamos asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

The gardner stood by a market stall, negotiating with the clark with a drycooper. The man quietly reminised about the pastHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Zamos. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Ximus is the best in town. His shop is into the market and towards the tavern. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the cattle barn. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the church. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the tavern. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 7 small coins. "I want that Audo gone as much as anybody."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. Two baggers finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Nearby, a drayman stood by a market stall, negotiating with the merchant. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Zamos cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Ximus lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The thought eater."

"These tiny predators of thought live almost their entire lives on the Ethereal Plane. They are so tied to that place that without its energy, a thought eater's psychic power begins to deplete, until finally the very fabric of its own personal reality breaks down and it fades out of existence. But while the Ethereal Plane is necessary for thought eaters' continued existence, its vastness and relative lack of prey force thought eaters to sometimes hunt on the Material Plane. Such trips are often gluttonous affairs, as the thought eaters must not only gain sustenance, but also gain enough nourishment to stave off their rapid psychic and physical decay in that hostile environment." Ximus explained.

Zamos slipped the man 4 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Ximus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Normally, thought eaters are fairly single-minded, but the inherent danger in their forays to the Material Plane makes them eager for easy meals. Someone who takes the time to provide consistent easy meals for a thought eater can expect the creature to follow her on the Ethereal Plane, watching for its next feeding time. Given that every minute on the Material Plane is strenuous for a thought eater, such a person is unlikely to receive much conversation from the creature trailing her, but if something threatens the safety of its food source, the thought eater may be moved to protect its companion. In this case, the thought eater uses its daze monster ability to help the person escape and may even be motivated to cast resist energy on her. If this bizarre and alien friendship continues for long enough, the thought eater may even choose to assist in identifying magic items—when properly compensated, of course."

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"That's all I can tell you."

Zamos saw a awful thought eater in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the beastly sight. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Zamos lunged toward the thought eater, his sword ready to strike! The slippery thought eater evaded Zamos's hit. The monster was stunned by the attack. He pulls a united nations blue potion from his pack and drinks it. He is reinvigorated.

## <a name="chapter11"></a> Chapter 11: Crow Wycoth Whelouthree and the Otyugh

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Crow Wycoth Whelouthree. The sherrif threw punches with a costermonger. A minnesinger ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Jehaulalius. Zamos continued down the path. Nearby, a hurdle maker slept in an alleyway.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a buffoon. Zamos approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Audo took over?" Zamos asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Two cooks threw punches. The man quietly reminised about the past, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Zamos. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Ardo is past the monastery. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. The bather finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a netmaker. Nearby, a lutenist ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Deukos. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Zamos cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the orca, or perhaps even the neothelid, but that's nothing compared to the otyugh we've got."

"Otyughs are particularly vile and horrid creatures that lurk in places most sane creatures avoid. Their lairs are middens, cesspools, offal pits, toxic swamps, and sewers—the greater a lair's filth, the greater the draw to the refuse-eating otyugh. They glory in the role of scavenger, wandering through vast underground caverns in search of the choicest cuts of garbage and waste. Upon finding such refuse, they gorge upon it, gathering what cannot be consumed in one debauch to bring back to their foul-smelling lairs. Otyughs spend most of their time in these filthy dens, which they keep constantly filled with carrion, dung, and worse sorts of stinking effluvia." Ardo explained.

Zamos slipped the man 5 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Ardo returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Intelligent creatures dwelling in subterranean areas near an otyugh often form a partnership of convenience with the disgusting beast. These creatures gladly provide their refuse and piles of raw meat to the otyugh, transforming the creature into an effective form of trash disposal. In return, the otyugh leaves its benefactors alone, and does not attack them, possibly even acting as a guardian."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the otyugh?" Zamos asked.

Ardo returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The most horrifying thing to most races about the notorious otyugh is not the nature of its diet or its choice of lairs, but rather that a creature with an otyugh's tastes can be anything other than a mindless scavenger. In fact, otyughs are surprisingly intelligent, and often quite eager to form alliances with those who offer them a steady supply of delicious diversions in the form of offal and waste. Most otyughs understand the fact that other creatures find them unpleasant and hideous, but few really care."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the otyugh?" Zamos asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Zamos.

Zamos saw a fairy otyugh in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the terrible sight. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter12"></a> Chapter 12: Bucens and the Bearded Devil (barbazu)

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Bucens. Two musicians hawked fine imported goods from Nordenthon. Nearby, a famulus gazed at him from an open window. Zamos continued down the path. The molecatcher talked excitedly with what appeared to be a bather with a pursuivant.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a locksmith. Zamos approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Audo took over?" Zamos asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a threadmaker eyed him suspiciously. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"Our village of Cark will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Maeli is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the left. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 7 small coins. "I want that Audo gone as much as anybody."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. While the drummer gazed at him from an open window, a wagoner scuttled out of his way. The smith eyed him suspiciously with a knifesmith. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Maeli looked up from his work behind a counter at Zamos.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Maeli grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of raeliss and giant ticks flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"Elite warriors in Hell's legions, bearded devils—or barbazus—fight savagely in the name of their infernal lords and command mindless hordes of the damned into battle. They collect and train with their infernally forged glaives among the vaults of Hell's third layer, Erebus, but inevitably return to the first layer, Avernus, to serve at the side of the dread lord Barbatos." Maeli explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the bearded devil (barbazu) so bad?" Zamos responded.

"Barbazus are fond of making charge attacks with their glaives, and try to maintain a 10-foot gap between themselves and their foes so they can use their signature polearms to great effect. Against a foe that has greater reach (or one able to otherwise avoid the devil's favored tactic), they drop their glaives and resort to their claws and hideous beards." Maeli explained.

Zamos slipped the man 6 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"At attention, bearded devils stand over 6 feet tall (though their squatting battle stances often make them appear shorter) and weigh upward of 200 pounds." Maeli explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the bearded devil (barbazu)?" Zamos asked.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Zamos.

Zamos saw a abhorrent bearded devil (barbazu) in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the unkind sight. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter13"></a> Chapter 13: Regill and the Orang-pendak

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Regill. A sailor ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Gillett. Nearby, a founder slept in an alleyway. Zamos continued down the path. Nearby, a silkwoman sat by the side of the road.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a boatman. The man, eying his foreboding cloak, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Audo took over?" Zamos asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a fishmonger stood by a market stall, negotiating with the beadle. He still looked suspiciousHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Zamos. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Teleos is into the market and towards the monastery. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the barn and right. You'll see a stables. It's just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. A cowherd talked excitedly with what appeared to be a threadmaker. While the coppersmith, redsmith stood by a market stall, negotiating with the hatter, a shepherd loaded a market stall with wares. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Teleos looked up from his work behind a counter at Zamos.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Teleos lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The orang-pendak."

"Orang-pendaks are a rare offshoot of the sasquatch species that dwells in remote mountainous jungles. Elusive and shy, they are rarely seen by other races. Given their friendship with apes (gibbons and orangutans in particular) and their hunched posture and shaggy fur—ranging from tawny or reddish to dark brown or black—they are often mistaken for those beasts at a distance. Orang-pendaks train apes and monkeys to hunt and fight for them, but despite the friendship and similar appearance, the species are not closely related." Teleos explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the orang-pendak?" Zamos asked.

Teleos returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Within their remote holds, Orang-pendaks cluster together into seminomadic tribes, hunting and gathering in a region until food and game becomes scarce, then moving on to the next area. Many tribes follow a regional pattern to this migration, allowing parts of the jungle to repopulate and gathering only enough substance so as not to disrupt the land's ability to recoup the losses."

Zamos slipped the man 4 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Teleos returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Orang-pendaks range from 3 to 5 feet tall as adults, weighing up to 150 pounds, and they are quite strong for their size. Orang-pendaks are largely herbivorous, but sometimes hunt with spears, clubs, and bolas."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the orang-pendak?" Zamos asked.

"That's all I can tell you."

Zamos saw a fairy orang-pendak in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the awful sight. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

The orang-pendak struck with its spear! The fierce blow from the monster narrowly misses he. He leaned on his sword to catch a moment's respite. He was worn out by the combat. The orang-pendak leans low, ready to strike with its might. 

Zamos lunged toward the orang-pendak, his sword ready to strike! The attack from Zamos surely left a impression. The monster was stunned by the attack. Zamos lunged toward the orang-pendak, his sword ready to strike! The slippery orang-pendak evaded Zamos's hit.

## <a name="chapter14"></a> Chapter 14: Norlow & Ladden and the Spider Swarm

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Norlow & Ladden. Nearby, a exchequer slept in an alleyway. The forester gazed at him from an open window with a parish priest. Zamos continued down the path. Two sailmakers gazed at him from an open window.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a cardmaker. Zamos approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Audo has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Zamos have come to destroy him!" Zamos exclaimed.

A procurator finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"Our village of Hil will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Daricus is into the market and towards the stables. Eventually you need to walk past the stables. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Daricus Fine Supplies". Tell him I sent you. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. A mercenary finished an apple and tossed the core aside. The mapmaker slowly carried supplies with a fisherman. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Daricus looked up from his work behind a counter at Zamos.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the norn, or perhaps even the megaloceros, but that's nothing compared to the spider swarm we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "The sight of a carpet of swarming spiders is unsettling indeed—particularly when the swarm is made up of spiders each the size of a gold coin and possessing blade-like mandibles capable of lacerating flesh with sickening ease. A swarm of spiders is a colonial mass of arachnids that relies on overwhelming much larger prey with sheer numbers rather than catching smaller snacks. While spider swarms spin webs, these webs are incapable of catching larger prey and typically serve the swarm as a lair rather than a method of capturing dinner."

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Zamos.

Zamos saw a disagreeable spider swarm in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the frightful sight. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

He pulls a amaranth potion from his pack and drinks it. He is reinvigorated. Zamos lunged toward the spider swarm, his sword ready to strike! The spider swarm was staggered by the immense force. 

The spider swarm struck with its swarm! The adventurer winces from the pain but continues fighting. The exhilarating combat made the hours seem like seconds. The spider swarm struck with its swarm! The fierce blow from the monster narrowly misses he. 

Zamos lunged toward the spider swarm, his sword ready to strike! The slippery spider swarm evaded Zamos's hit. The monster was stunned by the attack. He sneaked around to spider swarm's blind spot. 

He was victorious! The spider swarm menaced for no longer! 

## <a name="chapter15"></a> Chapter 15: Becouncoride Easte and the Janni

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Becouncoride Easte. Nearby, a landlord eyed him suspiciously. The silkmaid loaded a market stall with wares with a saltboiler. Zamos continued down the path. While the goldsmith stood by a market stall, negotiating with the tutor, a canon loaded a market stall with wares.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a spurrer. The man, eying his unusual weapons, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Zamos, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Audo." Zamos announced.

Nearby, a landlord slept in an alleyway. The man eyed him thoughtfully, then finally responded.

"Our village of Chead will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. You'll find Lapheus, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. The glover threw punches with a nailer. Two wheelwrights eyed him suspiciously. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Lapheus looked up from his work behind a counter at Zamos.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the cloud giant, or perhaps even the mummified gynosphinx, but that's nothing compared to the janni we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "The jann (singular janni) are the weakest of the genies. Jann are formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on the Material Plane. Some lore even casts the janni as the most "human" of the genie races, although most jann are quick to correct this insult, usually with the edge of a sword. A janni is human-sized, standing about 6 feet tall and weighing about 180 pounds."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the janni?" Zamos asked.

Lapheus returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Jann are physically strong and courageous, and do not take kindly to insult or injury. Most are quite prone to seeing insult even when none is intended by the speaker. If overwhelmed in battle, they escape using flight and invisibility, returning later with reinforcements."

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Jann enjoy their privacy, preferring the solitude of the deep desert and isolated oases. They are usually suspicious of humans, but are often willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Jann have a strong cultural tradition of hospitality, and will never turn away someone in need of food, water, or shelter, though they might expect payment in the form of a favor at some later date. "

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Among the other genie races, jann generally have good relations with both djinn and shaitans. While not actively enemies, jann dislike the proud and aloof marids. Jann have a distinct aversion to the efreet, who often try to enslave them or conscript them into their armies."

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"A small percentage of jann are noble. Noble jann, often called sheikhs or amirs, have 9 Hit Dice, Strength 19, and Intelligence 18, and gain the following spell-like abilities: 3/day—augury, detect magic, and divination. A noble janni's caster level for its spell-like abilities is 12th. Noble jann are CR 7." Lapheus explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the janni so bad?" Zamos responded.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Zamos.

Zamos saw a hideous janni in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the detestable sight. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter16"></a> Chapter 16: Che Parrouthfier and the Azruverda

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Che Parrouthfier. Two monks stood by a market stall, negotiating with the hunter. Two abbots finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Zamos continued down the path. A vintner loaded a market stall with wares.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a charcoalburner. Zamos approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Zamos, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Audo." Zamos announced.

Nearby, a pioneer gazed at him from an open window. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Garmity will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Raufrey is the best in town. His shop is past the stables. It's just to the right. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 2 small coins. "I want that Audo gone as much as anybody."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a lawyer slept in an alleyway. While the bard finished an apple and tossed the core aside, a silversmith eyed him suspiciously. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Raufrey looked up from his work behind a counter at Zamos.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the urannag, or perhaps even the vishkanya, but that's nothing compared to the azruverda we've got."

"Although repulsive in shape, these enormous, human-faced insectoid creatures are generally peaceful and serene. Left to its own devices, an azruverda is typically content to cultivate fungal gardens in deep underground sanctuaries. These gardens are beautiful to behold—masterful combinations of fungi, rocks, and other objects arranged in an artistic manner. Although generally solitary, azruverdas collaborate when a threat intrudes upon one of their underground homes. " Raufrey explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the azruverda?" Zamos asked.

Raufrey returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Azruverdas stand 16 feet tall on their many legs and weigh close to 4,000 pounds."

Zamos slipped the man 7 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Zamos.

Zamos saw a scary azruverda in the distance! The gallant Zamos readied his sword. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

He sneaked around to azruverda's blind spot. The azruverda struck with its bite! The fire-eating Zamos blocks the strike with his sword.

## <a name="chapter17"></a> Chapter 17: Sough and the Dragonne

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Sough. The sailmaker eyed him suspiciously with a wheelwright. Two dentists bit into an apple. Zamos continued down the path. Nearby, a famulus loaded a market stall with wares.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a armorer. The man, eying his determined look, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Zamos, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Audo." Zamos announced.

Two barbers slowly carried supplies. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"Our village of Stratford will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Lysian is past the church. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. The tapestrymaker threw punches with a poet. A silversmith stood by a market stall, negotiating with the maid. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Lysian looked up from his work behind a counter at Zamos.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the kappa, or perhaps even the soulbound doll, but that's nothing compared to the dragonne we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Possessing the savage instincts of lions with the cunning of brass dragons, dragonnes combine the fiercest features of these noble creatures into predators both awe-inspiring and deadly."

Zamos slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Lysian returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "The origin of dragonnes generates endless speculation. The odds of these creatures being direct crossbreeds of dragons and lions are quite remote, for numerous reasons: the two creatures rarely share the same territories; few creatures as clever as brass dragons would choose to mate with simple lions; and dragonne abilities differ significantly from those of metallic dragons. While otherworldly breeding experiments and magical mishaps remain possibilities, few satisfying explanations make themselves apparent.  "

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the dragonne?" Zamos asked.

Lysian returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Although many creatures rightly fear these ferocious hunters, few dragonnes are blatantly evil—most are just highly territorial and seek to defend their homes and hunting grounds from interlopers. Creatures that draw too close to a dragonne's lair are typically met by the resident's fearsome roar, followed by its claws and fangs if this warning is ignored. Those who attempt to settle in a dragonne's territory find themselves harassed constantly until they decide to leave or the dragonne is slain. These intimidating predators spend the majority of their time on the ground, even when in combat, since their wings prove somewhat ungainly. They typically search for prey and intruders from the air, then land nearby to charge and pounce. "

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the dragonne so bad?" Zamos responded.

"Despite their deadliness, dragonnes form strong bonds with those they consider members of their pride, sometimes even adopting creatures of other races. A character with the Leadership feat can take a dragonne as a cohort. Such characters must have an effective leadership level of 10th. Most dragonne cohorts gain levels in barbarian, fighter, or ranger." Lysian explained.

Zamos slipped the man 3 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Lysian returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "A dragonne measures between 10 and 12 feet long and weighs up to 1,200 pounds."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the dragonne so bad?" Zamos responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Zamos saw a fearful dragonne in the distance! He readied his sword. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

Zamos says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Lysian was talking about."

## <a name="chapter18"></a> Chapter 18: Lank and the Ocean Giant

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Lank. Two sea captains talked excitedly with what appeared to be a almoner. Nearby, a gunsmith scuttled out of his way. Zamos continued down the path. The bonecarver slowly carried supplies with a doctor.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a glover. Zamos approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Audo has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Zamos have come to destroy him!" Zamos exclaimed.

Two cardinals talked excitedly with what appeared to be a professor. The man quietly reminised about the past, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Craidger Park will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Cyridesmas is the best in town. His shop is just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. A troubadour stood by a market stall, negotiating with the builder. Two plattners sat by the side of the road. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Cyridesmas looked up from his work behind a counter at Zamos.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Cyridesmas grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of medium water elementals and deathtrap oozes flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

The armorer sighed and continued. "Ocean giants embody the great extremes of the sea. Their skin colors vary from deep blue to pale green, and their eyes and hair range from foamy white to coral pink. They decorate themselves with the treasures of the sea, wearing shell jewelry or scrimshaw, and clothing woven from underwater plants, or even salvaged sails. Each ocean giant carries a hand-crafted musical horn made from a conch shell, an object of cultural significance representing its family history and travels on the vast sea."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the ocean giant so bad?" Zamos responded.

"Many ocean giants view themselves as guardians of the sea, its creatures, and those who travel the waves, safeguarding their charges from remarkable coral towers. Others, however, claim domains measuring thousands of leagues, enslaving the beasts and aquatic races within and shattering any ship that dares trespass near their citadels of urchins and bones." Cyridesmas explained.

Zamos slipped the man 4 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Adult ocean giants stand approximately 22 feet tall and weigh about 15,000 pounds. Most live to be about 500 years old." Cyridesmas explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the ocean giant so bad?" Zamos responded.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Zamos.

Zamos says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Cyridesmas was talking about."

## <a name="chapter19"></a> Chapter 19: Cam and the Moon Giant

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Cam. The plumber gazed at him from an open window with a sheepshearer. Two ship's captains slept in an alleyway. Zamos continued down the path. While the crofter ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Hick, a hermit gazed at him from an open window.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a solicitor. The man, eying his impressive armor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Audo took over?" Zamos asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

A dung carter stood by a market stall, negotiating with the userer. He still looked suspicious, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Zamos. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Hypselmus is down the street to the inn and right. You'll see a tavern. It's past the church. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 10 small coins. "I want that Audo gone as much as anybody."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. Two chaplains loaded a market stall with wares. Nearby, a boatman eyed him suspiciously. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Hypselmus looked up from his work behind a counter at Zamos.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the cetus, or perhaps even the gate archon, but that's nothing compared to the moon giant we've got."

"Moon giants dwell in rocky badlands and other scarred, deserted places. They revere the moon, stars, and comets and seek wisdom in these celestial bodies' movements. Though they are normally placid scholars, more likely to enter a lively philosophical debate with other creatures than a brawl, moon giants can become violent when disturbed or when under the influence of a bad moon." Hypselmus explained.

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Most moon giants stand about 24 feet tall and weigh almost 18,000 pounds."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the moon giant so bad?" Zamos responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Zamos saw a lurid moon giant in the distance! The adventurer readied his sword. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

Zamos says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Hypselmus was talking about."

## <a name="chapter20"></a> Chapter 20: Oxforogroad and the Agyra

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Oxforogroad. A peddler gazed at him from an open window. Nearby, a leadworker eyed him suspiciously. Zamos continued down the path. While the furniture maker hawked fine imported goods from Heam, a saddler slowly carried supplies.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a sea captain. Zamos approached him, hoping for some advice.

"The evil wizard Audo has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Zamos have come to destroy him!" Zamos exclaimed.

The diplomat ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Spin with a sapper. The man sat in silence for a whileHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Zamos. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Gernielulf is into the market and towards the inn. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the cattle barn and left. You'll see a church. It's into the market and towards the stables. Eventually you need to walk just a bit further down the street. It's just to the right. Tell him I sent you. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. Nearby, a tanner stood by a market stall, negotiating with the baker. A water carrier loaded a market stall with wares. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Zamos cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Gernielulf lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The agyra."

Gernielulf returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Agyra, the Forever Storm, is believed by many cultures to be the cause of seasonal typhoons or other great storms—such tempests being a manifestation of Agyra's monstrous breaths as she exhales during her long slumber every season. While this kaiju is not in fact responsible for the world's storms, her powers over wind and lightning are significant, and when she is vexed to rampage, the effects of her hurricanes can be as devastating to a region as her more direct attacks."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the agyra?" Zamos asked.

Gernielulf returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Agyra has the appearance of a primeval, two-headed flying reptile with a wingspan of over 150 feet. Her tail is perhaps the most fearsome of her aspects. This lengthy and flailing appendage is covered with razor-sharp blades and wickedly barbed spines capable of slashing through buildings and tearing through armor with great force and from great distances."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the agyra so bad?" Zamos responded.

"Agyra dwells on the upper slopes of a long-dormant volcano that sits on a remote tropical island beyond the main shipping lanes and the scope of most explorers' travels. As with many kaiju, she spends the bulk of her time in deep and peaceful slumber. She is ferociously protective of the strange peoples who dwell on the shores of this island, and has been known to rouse herself to come to their defense against slavers, pirates, or other external threats to their way of life. Despite this strange protective streak, Agyra is not a kindly creature—and none know this more plainly than those who share her island. Her responses to intrusions to the island may simply be defenses of her perceived territories, for certainly the villages of the locals suffer significant damage during her local rampages. She's been known to take wing to travel to distant cities as well, often as a result of some of her island's inhabitants being taken from the shores as slaves. Yet the devastation she wreaks upon the slavers' destination cities pays no regard to the safety of the slaves themselves—they are in as much danger as anyone else from the kaiju's vengeful wrath in this situation." Gernielulf explained.

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Gernielulf returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "There are rumors that certain shamans on the isle conceal sacred words or some ancient ritual to waken and command Agyra, and that many of her rampages are not the result of the kaiju being territorial or protective, but simply due to an ancient bargain the natives' ancestors forged with the mighty beast in some forgotten era. Some speculate that such rituals require the sacrifice of trespassers, but this may be nothing more than fearful superstition or rumors spread by shamans to persuade foreigners to stay clear of their island."

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

Gernielulf returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Agyra has a particular hatred of the kaiju Mogaru, and often leaves her volcanic lair to fly west to the remote jungle lake that serves as Mogaru's home to clash with her nemesis. Mogaru's penchant for attacking coastal cities often results in a devastating escalation when Agyra arrives to do battle with the land-bound kaiju. Sometimes, methods of conjuring Agyra are used to deliberately lure the kaiju to a city besieged by Mogaru, but just as often her arrival seems to be driven by self-interest. Agyra typically manages to weaken Mogaru enough to drive him off, but is often slain herself in these battles, resurrecting and returning to her home at the same time Mogaru returns to his. The nature of this rivalry is unclear, but kaiju scholars believe that the two monsters have been enemies for longer than humanity has existed."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the agyra so bad?" Zamos responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

## <a name="chapter21"></a> Chapter 21: Redsens Cirmoury and the Swamp Mummy

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Redsens Cirmoury. The stewsman finished an apple and tossed the core aside with a threadmaker. Two paperers loaded a market stall with wares. Zamos continued down the path. A broderer slowly carried supplies.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a drycooper. The man, eying his dangerous demeanor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"The evil wizard Audo has terrorized these lands for far too long. I Zamos have come to destroy him!" Zamos exclaimed.

The merchant gazed at him from an open window with a singer. The man sat in silence for a while, but eventually responded.

"Our village of Osgow will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is down the street to the church and right. You'll see a barn. It's down the street to the warehouse and left. You'll see a tavern. It's into the market and towards the warehouse. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the cattle barn. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the stables and right. You'll see a church. It's down the street to the cattle barn and left. You'll see a barn. It's into the market and towards the barn. Eventually you need to walk into the market and towards the tavern. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the church and left. You'll see a warehouse. It's past the monastery. It's just to the left. You'll find Jurgainos, the best weapons expert we've got. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 2 small coins. "I want that Audo gone as much as anybody."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. Two summoners loaded a market stall with wares. A restaurateur slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Zamos cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the fire beetle, or perhaps even the tatzlwyrm, but that's nothing compared to the swamp mummy we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Strangled into unlife in the filth and muck of the deep mire, swamp mummies haunt the festering depths of isolated, desolate fenlands."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the swamp mummy?" Zamos asked.

"Some swamp mummies are cursed by dark powers to return to unlife, while others are the victims of sacrifices or criminal executions in which the bodies were thrown into a peat bog. The nature of the death and the emotional power of the victim are both contributing factors as to whether or not the victim crawls from its swampy grave as a swamp mummy." Jurgainos explained.

Zamos slipped the man 8 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Swamp mummies—also often called bog or peat mummies—rarely, if ever, leave their marshy realms. Those that do most often venture forth from the swamp to take revenge on their slayers. While most swamp mummies are motivated by vengeance, many fulfill these dark yearnings in a more general sense. Filled with wrath and hatred for the living, they mercilessly attack any living creatures that dare to venture into their dismal domains. Their agonized moans echo over their putrid homes, driving away the natural animals dwelling therein and often alerting travelers to the relentless danger." Jurgainos explained.

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "Swamp mummies delight in infecting living foes with bog rot, believing that adding their victims' essence to their gloomy domains expands their power. After battle, they carry away the bodies of their fallen victims to sink them in deep, isolated pools. Thus, even enemies that escape the bog rot become one with the swamp mummy's home."

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the swamp mummy?" Zamos asked.

"Most swamp mummies are Medium humanoids, typically arising from the submerged corpses of human, lizardfolk, or elven victims—though instances of swamp mummies arising from the corpses of other races is not unknown." Jurgainos explained.

Zamos slipped the man 4 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Zamos saw a abhorrent swamp mummy in the distance! The stouthearted Zamos readied his sword. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

Zamos says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Jurgainos was talking about."

## <a name="chapter22"></a> Chapter 22: Maidgater Stond Bath and the Yithian

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Maidgater Stond Bath. The coppersmith, redsmith ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Adlardus with a brewer. Nearby, a thimbler stood by a market stall, negotiating with the herald. Zamos continued down the path. The basketmaker eyed him suspiciously with a drummer.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a harberdasher. Zamos approached him, hoping for some advice.

"My name is Zamos, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Audo." Zamos announced.

The bather talked excitedly with what appeared to be a spy with a canaller. The man sat in silence for a while, then finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Zamos. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Willon is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the tavern and left. You'll see a cattle barn. It's past the warehouse. Look for the large hanging sign that reads "Willon Fine Supplies". I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. While the solicitor loaded a market stall with wares, a threadmaker slept in an alleyway. Nearby, a waterman slowly carried supplies. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Willon looked up from his work behind a counter at Zamos.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Willon grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of babaus and ancient gold dragons flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"Untold eons ago, the yithians inhabited a dying world. To escape their doomed planet, they cast their minds through time and space, eventually coming to rest in the strange, alien bodies they possess today. While these strange beings now reside in a distant galaxy, the yithians make use of their ability to astrally project to explore other planets, eager to find new worlds to explore." Willon explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the yithian so bad?" Zamos responded.

"When a yithian arrives upon a new world, it often swaps minds with the creatures it encounters there so as to experience that world as if it were a native. Those who spend time in a yithian's body rarely tell of the strange times they have experienced, for yithians guard themselves well, and leave those they use in this manner amnesiacs who remember the truth only as fragmentary nightmares." Willon explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the yithian so bad?" Zamos responded.

"Anything else you need to know can be found it the book. Take your time." He took the book of monsters and handed it to Zamos.

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Bywoorperd. While the pinmaker sat by the side of the road, a architect rushed by quickly, ignoring him. The siever gazed at him from an open window with a judge. Zamos continued down the path. A weirkeeper scuttled out of his way.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a embroiderer. The man, eying his impressive armor, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Audo took over?" Zamos asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Nearby, a swineherd hawked fine imported goods from Gild. The man quietly reminised about the past, then finally responded.

"Our village of Alquark will gladly help you on your quest. What do you need?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Stace is just a bit further down the street. There's a small door. Tell him I sent you. And here, take a few gold pieces to buy the best." He reached into his pocket and pulled out 5 small coins. "I want that Audo gone as much as anybody."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. A water carrier scuttled out of his way. Two master of houndss eyed him suspiciously. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Zamos cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Stace grabbed a dusty book from the shelf and flipped through it. Pictures of akhluts and satyrs flew by. Eventually he settled on a page and started to explain.

"These invertebrate parasitic relatives of the worm lurk in stagnant or slow-moving water, waiting for a suitable host." Stace explained.

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the giant leech so bad?" Zamos responded.

"That's all I can tell you."

Zamos saw a hideous giant leech in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the disgusting sight. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!

## <a name="chapter24"></a> Chapter 24: Pornpinst & Waster Paidge and the Fuath

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Pornpinst & Waster Paidge. The minnesinger loaded a market stall with wares with a gunsmith. A hayward eyed him suspiciously. Zamos continued down the path. While the lacemaker finished an apple and tossed the core aside, a housewife eyed him suspiciously.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a crofter. The man, eying his unusual weapons, beckoned him forward.

"Not many people around here like you." he said gruffly. "What makes you think you can step foot in these parts?"

"My name is Zamos, and it is my quest to defeat the evil wizard Audo." Zamos announced.

A hobbler ran from person to person, asking if they had seen Hewe. The man quietly reminised about the pastHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Zamos. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"Pris is the best in town. His shop is down the street to the warehouse and left. You'll see a cattle barn. It's into the market and towards the inn. Eventually you need to walk past the tavern. It's just to the left. I'd show you myself, but I have urgent matters to attend to here in the square."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. The troubadour rushed by quickly, ignoring him with a gluttonous fool. A glazier finished an apple and tossed the core aside. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

Pris looked up from his work behind a counter at Zamos.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

Pris lifted up his tunic and pointed to a scar. "You see this?" he asked. "Only one monster can do this kind of damage. The fuath."

Pris returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Drowners of sailors and sinkers of ships, a fuath (FOO-ah) is a wicked gremlin found in the sea. It climbs aboard ships in the dead of night to sever ropes, bore holes in barrels, soil provisions, and murder any hapless crew it puts to sleep or catches alone. It delights in drowning creatures by surrounding them with magically thickened water, cackling with wicked glee as its victims claw desperately for the air only inches from their mouths. "

Zamos slipped the man 10 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

"A fuath wears seaweed, shells, and coral like other creatures wear armor, clothes, and jewelry. Its body is protected by a hard, hunchbacked carapace. It stands less than 2 feet tall and weighs 12 to 15 pounds." Pris explained.

Zamos slipped the man 9 coins. "I get the feeling you've been here for a while. Surely you know more than that."

Pris returned to the book of monsters on the desk and pointed at the terrifying illustration. "Fuaths don't share a common language with other types of gremlins, though they can pantomime to each other fairly effectively. They have a surprising rapport with other sea creatures, even foul-tempered beasts like reefclaws. Small groups of fuaths lair in sea caves or rocky crevices. Larger groups frequently lay claim to whole sections of ruined ships. Their lairs usually include several trained guard animals. Fuaths prefer the taste of "land-meat" to anything from the sea, and often raid shore and ships to slake their hunger. They adore sea hags to the point of worship."

"I could handle that. Tell me again, what makes the fuath so bad?" Zamos responded.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Zamos saw a scandalous fuath in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the menacing sight. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might! 

Zamos lunged toward the fuath, his sword ready to strike! The slippery fuath evaded Zamos's hit. The monster was stunned by the attack. He pulls a toolbox potion from his pack and drinks it. He is reinvigorated.

Zamos says

"That didn't seem so hard, I don't know what Pris was talking about."

## <a name="chapter25"></a> Chapter 25: Bake and the Clockwork Leviathan

Zamos followed a dirt path into the village of Bake. Two cartwrights slept in an alleyway. A cartwright scuttled out of his way. Zamos continued down the path. The gemcutter slept in an alleyway with a fence.

Eventually, Zamos arrived at the town square, where he found a mapmaker. Zamos approached him, hoping for some advice.

"Do you remember the glory days before the evil wizard Audo took over?" Zamos asked. "I seek to destroy him and restore this kingdom's rightful rule!"

Two nakerers sat by the side of the road. The man eyed him thoughtfullyHe finally responded.

"We have waited for your arrival for many years, Zamos. Is there any way I can be of help?"

"My weapons were badly damaged on the way here. Could you point me to your armory to get some new supplies?"

"The armory is into the market and towards the cattle barn. Eventually you need to walk down the street to the warehouse and right. You'll see a church. It's into the market and towards the church. Eventually you need to walk past the inn. There's a small door. You'll find Bidebald, the best weapons expert we've got. Be careful out there. You're not the first to try this adventure. Men stronger than you have vanished or worse."

Zamos hurried towards the armory. A canaller eyed him suspiciously. Two turners rushed by quickly, ignoring him. Turning the corner, he saw the armory in front of him. He pushed the door open and walked inside.

There was no one there. Zamos cleared his throat and a man ran out from a backroom.

"I'm Zamos, a brave adventurer seeking to destroy Audo. What dangers lurk nearby?" he asked.

"Brave you say? You may have fought the elasmosaurus, or perhaps even the elder deep one, but that's nothing compared to the clockwork leviathan we've got."

The armorer sighed and continued. "Clockwork leviathans are equally capable of functioning on land and in water. Sailors who are haunted by the memories of these treacherous machines need not exaggerate their yarns, for the reality of an aquatic construct such as this holds enough terror in its story for even the hardiest of seafarers."

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

The armorer sighed and continued. "A clockwork leviathan's numerous metal plates and links are made of such resilient material that they never rust, even after long exposure to the briny sea waters that leviathans often patrol. "

Zamos looked surprised. "Incredible! Is there anything else I should know?"

"Clockwork leviathans are 25 feet long and weigh just over 3 tons." Bidebald explained.

"But my weapons may be too weak. Are there any other ways to defeat the clockwork leviathan?" Zamos asked.

"Look I've got other things to attend to. Do you need weapons or not?" His frusturation was visible.

Zamos saw a heinous clockwork leviathan in the distance! Our hero fixed his gaze on the mean sight. Zamos hurried towards the enemy, ready to strike it down with all his might!
