#### Dialogue and Memory ####

Characters have "memory"
Each character has a dictionary of what they know about an noun

    Who/What/Where/When/Why + Noun

That means that when an unfamiliar noun comes up in conversation, they may ask questions to develop the dialogue and increase their memory.

They also have 'feelings' toward objects or nouns.

    Love/Hate/Confusion/Anger/Sadness + Noun

These 'memories' are what drives dialogue.

#### Relationships ####

Relationships are also generated for characters.

Examples:
    Brother/Sister/Co-worker/Friend/Idol/Leader/Rival/etc.
